**Game Server Hosting with Pterodactyl Panel**  
Pterodactyl is a free, open-source game server management panel built with PHP (Laravel), React, and Go. It uses Docker containers to isolate game servers, providing enhanced security and resource control ([Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/#:~:text=Pterodactyl%C2%AE%20is%20a%20free%2C%20open,intuitive%20UI%20to%20end%20users)). With Pterodactyl, users get a modern web-based interface for starting, stopping, and monitoring game servers (CPU/RAM usage, console logs, file management, etc.) across one or many host machines. This report covers best practices for installing Pterodactyl on VPS or dedicated servers, compares popular cloud hosting providers for running Pterodactyl game servers, outlines which games are commonly hosted (and how they are supported via “eggs”), and discusses performance considerations (scalability, panel overhead, and resource allocation).

## 1. Setting Up Pterodactyl on VPS and Dedicated Servers  
**Choose a Supported OS and Environment:** Pterodactyl supports Ubuntu 20.04+ (including 22.04, 24.04), Debian 11/12, and Rocky/AlmaLinux 8/9 as base OS options ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=Operating%20System%20Version%20Supported%20Notes,Debian%2011%20%E2%9C%85%2012%20%E2%9C%85)). The official documentation uses Ubuntu 20.04 in examples, but any modern Linux distro with systemd will work. *Avoid OpenVZ/LXC-based VPS containers*, as they often lack proper Docker support – Pterodactyl’s Wings (daemon) **requires** a host that supports Docker (KVM or bare metal is recommended) ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=WARNING)) ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=To%20run%20Wings%2C%20you%20will,but%20there%20are%20edge%20cases)). For instance, OpenVZ virtualization is usually incompatible with Docker and will likely fail ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=WARNING)). Using a fresh server install is best practice to prevent conflicts; ensure you have root SSH access.

**Install Required Dependencies:** On the **Panel** server, you’ll need a LAMP/LEMP stack and associated packages: **PHP 8.2+** (with extensions: `cli`, `openssl`, `gd`, `mysql` (PDO), `mbstring`, `tokenizer`, `bcmath`, `xml`, `curl`, `zip`, and `fpm` for Nginx) ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=,%60tar)), **MySQL 8.0+** or MariaDB 10.2+, **Redis**, a web server (Apache or Nginx), **Git**, **curl**, **unzip**, and **Composer** (PHP dependency manager) ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=,%60tar)) ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=%23%20Install%20Dependencies%20apt%20,server)). The official documentation provides example commands for Ubuntu to add the PHP repository (ondrej/php), install MariaDB/Redis, etc ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=%23%20Add%20%22add,certificates%20gnupg)) ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=%23%20Install%20Dependencies%20apt%20,server)). On each **Wings node** (the server that actually runs game servers), the key requirement is **Docker CE**. You can install Docker via the official script: `curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | CHANNEL=stable bash` ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=)), then enable it to start on boot (`systemctl enable --now docker`). Ensure the Linux kernel supports Docker features; some hosts use custom kernels that disable memory cgroups, so verify with `docker info` (look for “WARNING: No swap limit support”) ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=Check%20your%20Kernel)) ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=On%20most%20systems%2C%20Docker%20will,near%20the%20bottom)). Pterodactyl recommends enabling swap accounting (adding `swapaccount=1` to the kernel line in GRUB and rebooting) so that Docker containers can use swap if needed, preventing out-of-memory crashes when a game server exceeds its RAM limit ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=On%20most%20systems%2C%20Docker%20will,near%20the%20bottom)).

**Panel Installation and Configuration:** It’s advised to install the Pterodactyl panel on a separate VPS or on a manager node (especially if you run a hosting business), but it can coexist with a game node on the same machine for small setups. Download the panel files (from the official GitHub release or using `curl` per docs), then run the installer commands (`php artisan p:environment:setup` to configure database credentials and URL, `php artisan migrate --seed` to set up the database, and `php artisan p:user:make` to create the first admin user) ([Getting started with Pterodactyl Panel - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-pterodactyl-panel/#:~:text=php%20artisan%20p%3Aenvironment%3Asetup%20php%20artisan,p%3Aenvironment%3Adatabase)) ([Getting started with Pterodactyl Panel - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-pterodactyl-panel/#:~:text=After%20the%20base%20data%2C%20you,run%20a%20few%20more%20commands)). Set file permissions for the web server user on `/var/www/pterodactyl` after installation ([Getting started with Pterodactyl Panel - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-pterodactyl-panel/#:~:text=php%20artisan%20p%3Auser%3Amake)). Next, configure the webserver: for example, set up an Nginx site pointing to the panel’s `public/` directory (the official docs provide configuration templates). Enable HTTPS for the panel domain – you can use Let’s Encrypt (Certbot) to obtain an SSL certificate ([Getting started with Pterodactyl Panel - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-pterodactyl-panel/#:~:text=SSL%20certificate%20setup)) ([Getting started with Pterodactyl Panel - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-pterodactyl-panel/#:~:text=need%20to%20install%20Certbot%20via,the%20given%20command)), as running the panel over HTTPS is important for security. Once the panel is running, you can **add nodes** via the Admin UI (Nodes section). For each new node, you will install the Wings daemon on the target server and link it to the panel using the auto-generated configuration and secret token. *Note:* Make sure the panel URL is reachable from the nodes and their clocks are in sync (to avoid any JWT token issues). It’s possible (and common) to run multiple Wings nodes with one panel – e.g. you might have Node1, Node2, etc., each on different machines, all managed under the same panel ([multiple nodes, 1 panel : r/Pterodactyl](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pterodactyl/comments/mgbqvn/multiple_nodes_1_panel/#:~:text=is%20it%20possible%20to%20run,if%20that%20makes%20sense)) ([multiple nodes, 1 panel : r/Pterodactyl](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pterodactyl/comments/mgbqvn/multiple_nodes_1_panel/#:~:text=,as%20an%20additional%20wings%20daemon)). The main consideration is to configure each node with the correct **panel API endpoint and SSL settings** (all nodes and panel should use either valid SSL or none; mixing SSL vs non-SSL in config will cause connection failures) ([multiple nodes, 1 panel : r/Pterodactyl](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pterodactyl/comments/mgbqvn/multiple_nodes_1_panel/#:~:text=Is%20this%20possible%3F)).

**Best Practices:**  
- **Use Latest Versions:** Follow the latest Pterodactyl release (1.x); panel and Wings versions must match. Update regularly for security patches.  
- **Isolate Panel from Game Load:** For better reliability, host the panel (PHP application and MySQL DB) on a separate small VPS or cloud instance. This way, high game server load on a node won’t slow down the web UI. The panel itself is lightweight (can run on 1 core, 1-2 GB RAM) but the database should be tuned if you manage hundreds of servers.  
- **Configure Queue Workers:** Pterodactyl offloads tasks like sending emails and processing server events to a background queue. Ensure you set up the queue worker (a systemd service running `php artisan queue:work`) as per docs ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=)) ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=Description%3DPterodactyl%20Queue%20Worker%20After%3Dredis)). This improves performance by handling installs, backups, and notifications asynchronously.  
- **Firewall and Ports:** Open/forward the necessary ports. By default, Wings uses port 8080 or 443 for its API (configurable) and 2022 for SFTP. Game servers will each need an allocation (port) set in the panel. If running behind Cloudflare or a proxy, see the docs for WebSocket configuration and daemon port changes (e.g., use 8443 for Wings behind Cloudflare) ([Running Pterodactyl behind Cloudflare's proxy | by Mark David](https://markd123.medium.com/running-pterodactyl-behind-cloudflares-proxy-964e9545a31d#:~:text=Running%20Pterodactyl%20behind%20Cloudflare%27s%20proxy,Visit%20your%20Pterodactyl%20wings)).  
- **Security:** Run the panel as an unprivileged user (web server user) and Wings as root (since it manages Docker). Keep your system and Docker up to date. It’s recommended to enable UFW/iptables and allow only needed ports (panel HTTPS, Wings daemon, SFTP, game ports). Also, the panel can generate **per-server MySQL databases** if you configure a database host in the Admin -> Databases section ([Configuring your Node Database | A Gamers Grind / XFGN / LM](https://docs.agamersgrind.com/guides/pterodactyl/configuring-your-database#:~:text=Configuring%20your%20Node%20Database%20,the%20left%2C%20click%20on%20Databases)) – for this, provide a MySQL user with privileges to create databases, or use an external DB server.  

## 2. Cloud Providers Comparison for Hosting Pterodactyl Servers  
Hosting Pterodactyl on a cloud VPS is very common. This section compares major providers – **DigitalOcean, Linode (Akamai), Vultr, Hetzner, OVH** (mid-tier cloud/VPS providers) – and the big **hyperclouds (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)** on key factors: pricing, performance, network quality, Docker support, and ease of setup.

**Pricing and Specs:** The table below shows a sample VM configuration (around 2 vCPUs and 4 GB RAM, suitable for hosting a few game servers) on each provider and its approximate cost:

| Provider             | Sample Instance (2 vCPU, ~4 GB)                             | Hourly Price       | Monthly Price       |

**Notes:** Prices above are for **on-demand Linux VMs** in USD, using each provider’s closest plan (as of early 2025). *DigitalOcean, Linode, and Vultr* have straightforward pricing (bandwidth included, charges only if you exceed limits). *Hetzner* offers by far the best price-to-spec (a 4 GB cloud VM for under $5), but their data centers are primarily in Europe (and recently the US) – great for EU users and anyone on a budget ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=But%20that%20comes%20with%20a,a%20much%20lower%20cost%20price)) ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=The%20situation%20is%20completely%20different,of%20technical%20performance%20and%20price)). *OVH* provides very affordable VPS and specialized “Game” dedicated servers; their VPS Essential 4GB is about $11, and their higher tiers scale up to 8 vCores, 16 GB for under $20 ([Low-Cost, High-Performance VPS | Starter VPS | OVHcloud Worldwide](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/vps/cheap-vps/#:~:text=VPS%20solutions%20that%20adapt%20to,4%20to%208%20GB%20RAM)). AWS Lightsail is Amazon’s simplified VPS offering with flat pricing similar to DigitalOcean (e.g. $20 for 4GB) ([Free Cloud Server - Free Lightsail - AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/compute/lightsail/#:~:text=Free%20Cloud%20Server%20,16%20GB%20%C2%B7%204%20vCPU)). Standard AWS EC2 instances cost more (around $50+ monthly for a modest VM) ([DigitalOcean vs Vultr vs Akamai/Linode vs Hetzner vs AWS vs ...](https://spinupwp.com/blog/digitalocean-vs-google-cloud-vs-aws/#:~:text=DigitalOcean%20vs%20Vultr%20vs%20Akamai%2FLinode,42%2Fmo)), and GCP/Azure are in a similar or higher range (GCP often slightly higher than AWS for comparable VMs ([DigitalOcean vs Vultr vs Akamai/Linode vs Hetzner vs AWS vs Google Cloud](https://spinupwp.com/blog/digitalocean-vs-google-cloud-vs-aws/#:~:text=Performance,wise%2C%20at%20only%20%2410%2Fmonth))). Note that all cloud providers also charge for additional storage or bandwidth if you go beyond the plan’s included amount (AWS/GCP in particular have separate bandwidth charges, whereas others include a few TB).

**Performance (CPU, RAM, Disk I/O):** Not all vCPUs are equal – CPU clock speeds and contention differ. In independent benchmarks, **Hetzner** consistently ranks at or near the top in raw performance for similar VM sizes, often leading in multi-core and memory throughput tests ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=The%20situation%20is%20completely%20different,of%20technical%20performance%20and%20price)) ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=In%20the%20Apache%20benchmark%2C%20Hetzner%2C,RAM%20memory)). For example, in one January 2024 benchmark of 4 vCPU VMs, Hetzner was the *“big winner… in terms of technical performance and price”*, leading the pack in CPU (7-zip) and memory (STREAM) tests ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=The%20situation%20is%20completely%20different,of%20technical%20performance%20and%20price)). **Vultr** is known for its High Frequency plans with fast CPUs (3.8+ GHz Ryzen/Intel chips and NVMe SSDs), which showed strong memory and CPU performance as well (Vultr placed among top 3 in certain CPU tests and had excellent memory bandwidth results) ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=benchmark%20failed%20time%20and%20time,no%20results%20could%20be%20achieved)) ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=In%20the%20Apache%20benchmark%2C%20Hetzner%2C,RAM%20memory)). **DigitalOcean** and **Linode** use a mix of Intel and AMD processors; their performance is solid, but in price-to-performance they can be a bit behind Hetzner. In the same benchmarks, DO and Linode were described as *“very expensive”* for the performance delivered, whereas Hetzner offered similar or better performance at a fraction of the cost ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=Price,a%20lot%20for%20the%20price)) ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=especially%20earns%20a%20lot%20of,RAM%20memory)). It’s worth noting Linode’s tested plan had half the RAM in one scenario (8GB vs others’ 16GB) which affected some results ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=Note%3A%20the%20Linode%20server%20only,had%208%20GB%20of%20ram)), but generally Linode and DO are roughly on par with each other (both emphasize balanced, reliable performance over raw speed). **OVHcloud’s** public cloud VMs have somewhat inconsistent performance – one test noted an OVH instance *failed to complete* a certain Apache benchmark and “scored very low” in others ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=Vultr%20was%20in%20the%20middle,no%20results%20could%20be%20achieved)). This suggests OVH’s cloud instances might use older CPUs or have stricter throttling. However, OVH’s **dedicated Game servers** (not VMs but actual bare-metal machines) offer **top-end hardware** (e.g. latest-gen AMD EPYC CPUs with high single-core clocks, DDR5 RAM, NVMe) for demanding workloads ([Game-1 Dedicated Server](https://us.ovhcloud.com/bare-metal/game/game-1/#:~:text=Get%20world,data%20access%20and%20smooth%20gameplay)). Those are essentially dedicated servers and can run dozens of game servers without the virtualization overhead. **Disk I/O** on providers like DO, Vultr, and Linode is generally fast (all offer SSDs, and many now use NVMe SSDs for higher IOPS). In fact, DigitalOcean upgraded to NVMe storage on their premium droplets, and Linode/Akamai has rolled out NVMe on all block storage as well ([Linode has the Fastest NVMe Storage Around | Akamai](https://www.linode.com/content/linode-has-the-fastest-nvme-based-block-storage-among-all-cloud-providers/#:~:text=Linode%20has%20the%20Fastest%20NVMe,read%20performance%2C%20random%20read)). One community comparison found DO’s NVMe-based volumes about *10–20% faster* than Linode’s older SSDs in benchmarks ([Linode vs Digital Ocean Comparison : r/webdev - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/17w8o6d/linode_vs_digital_ocean_comparison/#:~:text=But%20in%20the%20benchmarks%20I%27ve,you%20choose%20NVMe%20you)), but Linode has since introduced NVMe in 2023 ([Linode has the Fastest NVMe Storage Around | Akamai](https://www.linode.com/content/linode-has-the-fastest-nvme-based-block-storage-among-all-cloud-providers/#:~:text=Linode%20has%20the%20Fastest%20NVMe,read%20performance%2C%20random%20read)). For most game servers (which aren’t extremely I/O heavy, except maybe for Minecraft world saves or ARK backups), the disk performance on these providers is more than sufficient. Hetzner’s storage also performs well (one test showed **Scaleway** and Hetzner leading in disk throughput, with Scaleway far ahead in a specific storage benchmark, but Scaleway was much pricier) ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=Vultr%20and%20Scaleway%20are%20the,leaves%20everyone%20else%20far%20behind)). In summary: *Hetzner and Vultr* offer the best raw performance per dollar for typical game server loads, *DO and Linode* provide reliable and consistent performance with easy scaling, *OVH* might lag in cloud VM performance but has unique high-performance bare-metal options, and *AWS/GCP/Azure* give you access to high-end instance types (even GPUs or 10Gb networking) at a much higher cost.

**Network Quality and DDoS Protection:** Network latency and stability are crucial for game hosting. All these providers have data centers in multiple regions, so you should choose a location close to your player base. **DigitalOcean** has 8+ regions (NYC, SF, Toronto, London, Frankfurt, Bangalore, Singapore, etc.) and a generally robust network with a 99.99% uptime SLA for droplets ([Linode vs DigitalOcean - Which is the #1 VPS provider in 2025](https://www.mamboserver.com/hosting/linode-vs-digitalocean/#:~:text=DigitalOcean%20offers%20an%20impressive%2099.99,based%20on%20an%20hourly%20rate)). **Linode** (now Akamai) similarly has many regions (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific); Linode’s SLA is 99.9% ([Linode vs DigitalOcean - Which is the #1 VPS provider in 2025](https://www.mamboserver.com/hosting/linode-vs-digitalocean/#:~:text=DigitalOcean%20offers%20an%20impressive%2099.99,based%20on%20an%20hourly%20rate)) and they’ve historically had slightly higher network latency in some comparisons. For example, one latency test showed DO with 47 ms vs Linode 51 ms to a given client, and DO had higher download throughput in that case ([Linode vs DigitalOcean - Which is the #1 VPS provider in 2025](https://www.mamboserver.com/hosting/linode-vs-digitalocean/#:~:text=Here%E2%80%99s%20a%20snippet%20of%20a,conducted%20between%20DigitalOcean%20and%20Linode)) – but such differences may vary by route and are usually minor. **Vultr** stands out by having one of the largest location footprints (20+ locations worldwide, including many in Asia/Australia where others might have 1-2). Vultr’s network is generally good; bandwidth caps are a bit lower (e.g. 3 TB on the 4GB plan vs 4 TB on DO/Linode), but you can purchase more. Vultr and DO include basic DDoS mitigation on their platforms, but it’s not specialized for game traffic. **OVH** is *notable for DDoS protection* – it’s a core feature of their services. OVH’s network can absorb very large attacks (they advertise mitigation up to 1.3 Tbps) ([Anti-DDoS Infrastructure - OVHcloud](https://us.ovhcloud.com/security/anti-ddos/#:~:text=Anti,3Tbps%20in%20size)). In particular, OVH’s **Game servers** come with “Game DDoS Protection,” which is tailored to filter game-specific traffic patterns (TCP/UDP protocols for popular games) in real time ([OVHcloud® US Launches Third-Generation Bare Metal Game Servers Featuring AMD EPYC 4004 Processors](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241204561607/en/OVHcloud-US-Launches-Third-Generation-Bare-Metal-Game-Servers-Featuring-AMD-EPYC-4004-Processors#:~:text=,support%20and%20safeguard%20game%20hosting)) ([Game-1 Dedicated Server](https://us.ovhcloud.com/bare-metal/game/game-1/#:~:text=,Service%20Level%20Agreement%20%28SLA)). Many game hosting companies use OVH dedicated servers in part for this strong anti-DDoS capability. OVH has data centers in Europe (France, UK, Germany) and North America (Beauharnois in Canada, Vint Hill in US-East, and a US-West site) – so coverage is decent, though not as extensive in Asia. **Hetzner**’s network is excellent in Europe (locations in Germany and Finland) and they launched a US East coast location in 2022. Hetzner includes generous traffic (20 TB, then throttled) and basic DDoS protection (they have mitigation systems, though not as specifically “game-tuned” as OVH’s) – for most users, Hetzner’s network is reliable and a *huge cost saver on bandwidth* compared to AWS/GCP, which charge for egress (Hetzner’s bandwidth fees beyond the generous free allotment are only a few € per TB, whereas “big cloud” can charge ~$90/TB if you exceed free tiers) ([Hetzner lowers pricing of Intel cloud servers | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40594817#:~:text=immibis%20%20%2067%20,next%20%5B%E2%80%93)) ([Hetzner lowers pricing of Intel cloud servers | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40594817#:~:text=leave%20offer%3F)). **AWS/GCP/Azure** have the most global regions and very high backbone quality. AWS and Google have private fiber networks connecting their regions and typically offer low latency connections worldwide (and services like AWS Global Accelerator or Cloudflare Spectrum can further optimize routing for gaming). However, by default an EC2 or GCE instance doesn’t include special DDoS protection beyond the standard infrastructure – Amazon does have **AWS Shield Advanced** and AWS Firewall Manager (at additional cost) which can mitigate large DDoS attacks, and Azure has **DDoS Protection Standard** service, etc. These can be expensive add-ons. Amazon Lightsail instances include a few TB of bandwidth (as noted above) and are simpler, but for massive attacks, a solution like OVH might still fare better out-of-the-box for a gaming context. To summarize networks: If you anticipate DDoS attacks (common in competitive games or public Minecraft servers), **OVH** is a top choice due to included protection ([OVHcloud® US Launches Third-Generation Bare Metal Game Servers Featuring AMD EPYC 4004 Processors](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241204561607/en/OVHcloud-US-Launches-Third-Generation-Bare-Metal-Game-Servers-Featuring-AMD-EPYC-4004-Processors#:~:text=,support%20and%20safeguard%20game%20hosting)). Others provide decent basic DDoS mitigation (volumetric attacks will usually be absorbed to some extent, but application-specific attacks might still cause lag). Latency-wise, pick a provider with a region near your players: DO, Linode, Vultr cover most continents; Hetzner is ideal for EU (and now US East); AWS/Azure/GCP have the widest reach if you need something like South America or Africa (though Azure and Oracle Cloud are options there). Also consider network throughput – e.g., OVH Game servers come with a full 1 Gbps port guaranteed ([OVHcloud® US Launches Third-Generation Bare Metal Game Servers Featuring AMD EPYC 4004 Processors](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241204561607/en/OVHcloud-US-Launches-Third-Generation-Bare-Metal-Game-Servers-Featuring-AMD-EPYC-4004-Processors#:~:text=,support%20and%20safeguard%20game%20hosting)), whereas VPS providers typically share a 1 Gbps port (you might effectively get 200–500 Mbps throughput in practice, which is plenty for dozens of players).

**Virtualization & Docker Support:** All the listed cloud providers use hypervisors (KVM, Xen, etc.) that fully support running Docker and systemd. This means you can deploy the Pterodactyl panel and Wings on any of these VPS instances without low-level compatibility issues. The only caution is with some very low-end providers or older “OpenVZ” based VPS plans (not usually the case with the major providers mentioned). As noted earlier, Pterodactyl will not run on OpenVZ 6 containers due to Docker restrictions ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=WARNING)). Providers like DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, Hetzner all use KVM virtualization for their VPS, so you have full control and can load custom kernel modules, etc. Running Docker is straightforward on these platforms – for example, DigitalOcean provides a one-click image with Docker pre-installed, and others have marketplace apps (though not specifically for Pterodactyl, you can find community scripts on GitHub that automate the panel installation on a fresh VPS). In short, **Docker and systemd are supported by default on all major cloud VMs**; you won’t face virtualization issues on DO/Linode/Vultr/Hetzner/AWS/GCP (they effectively behave like a normal Linux server) ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=To%20run%20Wings%2C%20you%20will,but%20there%20are%20edge%20cases)) ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=When%20your%20provider%20uses%20,KVM%20is%20guaranteed%20to%20work)). One thing to note is **nested virtualization**: if you ever tried to run a VM inside your VPS (not common for Pterodactyl usage), that might be disallowed. But running Docker, which uses OS-level virtualization, is fine. Also, ensure your kernel on the VM has necessary features (some providers like OVH allow custom kernels – if a custom kernel is used, make sure it has cgroup support for memory accounting, etc., otherwise Docker might show that swap limit or other cgroup features are unavailable ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=Check%20your%20Kernel))). Usually, using the distribution’s stock kernel (Ubuntu’s, etc.) on these cloud VMs is recommended.

**Ease of Setup and Management:** Developer-focused clouds like DigitalOcean, Linode, and Vultr are known for their simplicity. For a newcomer, **DigitalOcean**’s interface and documentation are very user-friendly – you can spin up a droplet in a couple of minutes, and DO has community tutorials (including for Pterodactyl installation). Linode’s dashboard is also straightforward, though a tad more utilitarian. Vultr offers a web console and even upload of ISO images if you want custom OS installs. All three have one-click app marketplaces; at the time of writing, Pterodactyl isn’t an official one-click, but there are community installation scripts (e.g. “Pterodactyl-installer” on GitHub) that work on these platforms. **Hetzner**’s cloud console is a bit less polished (it’s functional but not as pretty or intuitive as DO’s) – one review noted “their dashboard isn’t as nice as most others, but it gets the job done” ([DigitalOcean vs Vultr vs Akamai/Linode vs Hetzner vs AWS vs Google Cloud](https://spinupwp.com/blog/digitalocean-vs-google-cloud-vs-aws/#:~:text=match%20at%20L168%20offer%20a,it%20gets%20the%20job%20done)). Hetzner requires some comfort with setting up networking (their default images are minimal), but they do provide cloud-init and an API as well. **OVH** can be slightly more complicated to navigate; their US and EU panels differ, and deploying a VPS or dedicated server has a few more steps (OVH is more oriented towards experienced users). That said, once the server is up, installing Pterodactyl is the same process on any Ubuntu/Debian system. One issue to watch: OVH’s older VPS lines might have custom kernels (as mentioned) – if so, switching to a distro kernel can help Docker compatibility per Pterodactyl’s documentation ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=Check%20your%20Kernel)). **AWS and Google Cloud** are the most complex for beginners. AWS EC2 requires configuring VPC networks, security groups (firewall rules), keys, etc., which is overkill for a single game VM. The AWS console has a steep learning curve and many options that aren’t needed for a basic game server ([DigitalOcean vs Vultr vs Akamai/Linode vs Hetzner vs AWS vs Google Cloud](https://spinupwp.com/blog/digitalocean-vs-google-cloud-vs-aws/#:~:text=AWS%20provides%20a%20wide%20range,usage%2C%20depending%20on%20the%20service)) ([DigitalOcean vs Vultr vs Akamai/Linode vs Hetzner vs AWS vs Google Cloud](https://spinupwp.com/blog/digitalocean-vs-google-cloud-vs-aws/#:~:text=Check%20out%20our%20Amazon%20Lightsail,doc%20for%20more%20details)). **Amazon Lightsail**, however, was created to bridge this gap – Lightsail presents a simplified UI where you choose a plan (e.g. 4GB, $20), a region, and launch, similar to DO ([DigitalOcean vs Vultr vs Akamai/Linode vs Hetzner vs AWS vs Google Cloud](https://spinupwp.com/blog/digitalocean-vs-google-cloud-vs-aws/#:~:text=Enter%20Amazon%20Lightsail%2C%20which%20you,monthly%20cost%20for%20each%20server)). It even shows you the static IP and credentials, and allows quick setup without dealing with all of AWS’s networking intricacies. So for AWS, Lightsail is strongly recommended for Pterodactyl unless you specifically need an EC2 feature. **Google Cloud** is slightly more user-friendly than raw AWS – their Compute Engine lets you launch a VM via a wizard, but you might still have to open ports in the GCP firewall. Google’s pricing UI is not very transparent (you rely on a calculator estimate) ([DigitalOcean vs Vultr vs Akamai/Linode vs Hetzner vs AWS vs Google Cloud](https://spinupwp.com/blog/digitalocean-vs-google-cloud-vs-aws/#:~:text=Google%20Cloud%20is%20similar%20to,when%20deploying%20a%20VM%20instance)). **Azure** is also quite complex, with a large portal and sometimes confusing pricing for VM series. In summary, if ease of setup is a priority, **Lightsail or Vultr/DO/Linode** will give you the smoothest experience. In a recent comparison, developers concluded that *“Vultr, Hetzner, Akamai (Linode), and DigitalOcean all offer a refined, focused user experience that’s reliable and easy to set up,”* whereas AWS and GCP, while powerful, *“can be daunting to use”* without simplification layers ([DigitalOcean vs Vultr vs Akamai/Linode vs Hetzner vs AWS vs Google Cloud](https://spinupwp.com/blog/digitalocean-vs-google-cloud-vs-aws/#:~:text=simplicity%2C%20and%20pricing,and%20easy%20to%20set%20up)) ([DigitalOcean vs Vultr vs Akamai/Linode vs Hetzner vs AWS vs Google Cloud](https://spinupwp.com/blog/digitalocean-vs-google-cloud-vs-aws/#:~:text=With%20so%20many%20cloud%20providers,and%20easy%20to%20set%20up)). The Pterodactyl community is very active on Discord and forums, so whichever host you choose, you can likely find guides or help specific to that provider if needed.

## 3. Popular Games Hosted on Pterodactyl and Egg Support Levels  
Pterodactyl is capable of hosting practically any game server that can run on Linux (and even some that require Wine/Mono or custom environments). It uses a system of **“nests” and “eggs”** to define server configurations. An “egg” is essentially a pre-defined template for a game server, including the Docker image or startup script, default installation files, and variables (like max memory, world name, etc.). Pterodactyl’s core team maintains a set of **official eggs** for many common games, and the community contributes many others.

**Officially Supported (“Core”) Games:** According to the Pterodactyl documentation, core supported games include ([Introduction | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/project/introduction.html#supported-games#:~:text=Some%20of%20our%20core%20supported,games%20include)) ([Introduction | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/project/introduction.html#supported-games#:~:text=)): 

- **Minecraft** (Java Edition and forks) – *Eggs for Spigot/Paper, Sponge, Bungeecord/Waterfall proxies, Forge, etc. are included*. (Minecraft is by far one of the most hosted games on Pterodactyl.)  
- **Rust** – *Official egg available*.  
- **Terraria** – *Official egg*.  
- **TeamSpeak 3** – *Voice server egg*.  
- **Mumble** – *Voice server egg*.  
- **Team Fortress 2** – *Source engine dedicated server egg*.  
- **Counter-Strike: Global Offensive** – *Official egg (CS:GO server)*.  
- **Garry’s Mod** – *Official egg*.  
- **ARK: Survival Evolved** – *Official egg (this game is resource-heavy, but Pterodactyl can manage it with the provided egg using SteamCMD to install)*.

These official eggs are maintained in the primary **Pterodactyl/eggs** repository (sometimes referred to as the “standard” nest). They come bundled or can be imported easily. Having an official egg means that the game’s installation and startup parameters have been pre-configured by the Pterodactyl team, and they likely receive updates when the panel updates.

**Community and Custom Eggs:** Beyond the core list, the community has created eggs for dozens of other games and software. The documentation notes examples such as ([Introduction | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/project/introduction.html#supported-games#:~:text=provided%20by%20the%20community,of%20these%20games%20include)):

- **Factorio** – *community-provided egg*.  
- **San Andreas Multiplayer (SA:MP)** – *community egg*.  
- **PocketMine-MP (Minecraft Bedrock server)** – *community egg available*.  
- **Squad** – *community egg*.  
- **FiveM (GTA V multiplayer mod)** – *community egg (very popular for GTA communities)*.  
- **Xonotic** – *community egg*.  
- **Discord bots (e.g. ATLBot)** – *eggs for certain bot hosting environments*.

The community eggs were historically hosted in a repo called `parkervcp/eggs` or `community eggs` (recently read-only during a migration to a new system called “Pelican” panel eggs) ([Current list of supported games : r/Pterodactyl](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pterodactyl/comments/1d7oddz/current_list_of_supported_games/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)). Now, many eggs can be found on forums or the official Discord. Generally, if a game has a dedicated server binary for Linux, someone has likely made a Pterodactyl egg for it. For example, eggs exist for **Valheim**, **Outward**, **Barotrauma**, **Eco**, **Don't Starve Together**, **Project Zomboid**, **HLDS games (Counter-Strike 1.6, etc.)**, **Call of Duty 4**, **Battlefield** series via Wine, and more. The community has even provided eggs for non-game software like **pex** (BungeeCord proxies), **MongoDB**, **Jupyter Notebook** – though those are more edge cases of using Pterodactyl as a general container orchestrator.

- *Level of support:* **Official eggs** (like the Minecraft or CS:GO eggs) are generally well-tested and kept up to date with the panel. **Community eggs** might require specific Docker images or have quirks, but usually come with instructions. For instance, a FiveM egg might require you to agree to a license key from Cfx.re. Pterodactyl’s service daemon (Wings) will pull the required Docker image for an egg automatically – many eggs use generic images (like an Ubuntu base with dependencies). Some community eggs use custom Docker images (which are usually pulled from Docker Hub). If an egg isn’t available, you can always try to create your own: Pterodactyl allows custom launch parameters and startup scripts. This is a manual process and considered advanced, but the panel’s **“Creating a Custom Egg”** guide explains how to package a game server that Pterodactyl doesn’t natively support ([Creating a Custom Egg - Pterodactyl Panel](https://pterodactyl.io/community/config/eggs/creating_a_custom_egg.html#:~:text=Creating%20a%20Custom%20Egg%20,in%20the%20egg%20startup%2C)). In the worst case, you could run the game server in a generic container with a bash shell – but then you lose the benefit of automation. The good news is that games like *Minecraft (Java and Bedrock), ARK, Rust, Valheim, CS:GO, Garry’s Mod, ARMA, etc.* all have readily available eggs either officially or via community. Even newer games usually get community support within weeks of release if there’s demand.

- *Egg status:* An **official egg** means it’s part of Pterodactyl’s standard set (often referred to as the “Packaged Egg” or default nest). These eggs are maintained by Pterodactyl staff – e.g. the Minecraft egg is included out-of-the-box. A **community egg** means you might have to import it. Importing an egg is done via the panel’s Eggs UI (upload the JSON file for the egg). This will create a new service option under a “nest” (category). The panel by default has nests like “Minecraft”, “Source Engine”, etc. Community eggs might instruct you to create a new nest or use an existing one. **Manual setup** (no egg) is rarely necessary unless the game is very uncommon or proprietary. But if needed, you can always start with a generic Linux egg and then install the server manually inside the container (similar to how you’d do on a normal server). This is not as integrated (the panel wouldn’t know how to automatically update or start it without you configuring that), so creating a custom egg is preferred for repeatability.

In summary, **Minecraft** (all variants) is fully supported with official eggs and is one of the most common uses of Pterodactyl. Other big titles like **Rust, ARK, CS:GO, GMod, TF2, etc.** are officially supported as well ([Introduction | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/project/introduction.html#supported-games#:~:text=Some%20of%20our%20core%20supported,games%20include)). The community extends support to dozens more games – check the Pterodactyl eggs repository or community listings for a full list. Virtually any game server that can run on a Linux machine can be run under Pterodactyl, it’s mainly a question of whether an egg recipe is available or if you need to script the startup yourself.

## 4. Pterodactyl Performance Considerations and Limitations  
While Pterodactyl makes managing game servers much easier, it’s important to understand its performance overhead and design limits to scale effectively.

**Panel & Daemon Architecture:** Pterodactyl has a central **Panel** (web UI and API, backed by a MySQL database and Redis queue) and one or more **Wings** daemons (which run on each node to manage containers). The panel itself is not very CPU-intensive; it mostly handles user requests and orchestrates tasks via the queue. Even a modest VM can handle dozens or hundreds of server entries in the database. The heavier work happens on the Wings side: starting/stopping servers (spawning Docker containers), executing install scripts, and funneling console output and stats back to the panel (Wings sends websocket updates for server status and resource usage).

**Concurrent Server Management:** Pterodactyl’s workflow is queue-driven. Actions like installing a server or performing automated backups are queued and processed sequentially by default ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=We%20make%20use%20of%20queues,setup%20the%20queue%20worker%20for)) ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=ExecStart%3D%2Fusr%2Fbin%2Fphp%20%2Fvar%2Fwww%2Fpterodactyl%2Fartisan%20queue%3Awork%20,tries%3D3%20StartLimitInterval%3D180%20StartLimitBurst%3D30)). This means if you trigger many actions at once (e.g. boot 50 servers simultaneously), the panel won’t overload the system by doing all in parallel – it will process through them, a few at a time (you can configure multiple queue workers for higher concurrency if needed). Starting and stopping servers are fairly lightweight (Docker can spin up containers quickly), but if all your servers launch at the exact same time (for example, after a power node reboot), there could be a short burst of high CPU/disk as all Docker containers initialize. In practice, most users stagger their servers or start only what’s needed. **Scalability:** There are installations of Pterodactyl managing hundreds of game servers across multiple nodes. The design is horizontally scalable: you can add as many Wings nodes as required, and the panel will just see more “allocations” to deploy to. The panel isn’t (currently) clustered – you can’t have multiple panel instances sharing one DB for load-balancing, so typically one panel instance is used. If it becomes a bottleneck, one can scale the panel vertically (give it a stronger DB server or more PHP workers). For very large communities, running the MySQL database on a dedicated machine and enabling Redis caching is recommended. Also, Pterodactyl’s panel supports Redis-based caching and session storage, which improve performance when many users are accessing the UI simultaneously.

**Resource Overhead of Docker:** Since each game server runs in a Docker container, there is a slight overhead compared to running all servers directly on the host. This overhead is mostly in memory and some CPU due to container isolation. For example, one user reported that **each Docker container used by Pterodactyl had a notable RAM overhead** – in their case, a Minecraft server given 16 GB would use about 14.5 GB in-game with ~1.5-2 GB overhead from Docker/Pterodactyl ([I recently moved to pterodactyl and I've been noticing a high usage of ram : r/admincraft](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/o6w9qh/i_recently_moved_to_pterodactyl_and_ive_been/#:~:text=Ptero%20has%20significant%20RAM%20overhead,5GB)). This overhead can include the base OS libraries, the JVM overhead outside the heap, and cgroup accounting. Pterodactyl’s Wings will always allocate the full memory limit to the container (e.g., a server with “4096 MB” limit will have a cgroup limit of 4GB; the game may not use it all, but the container itself might show slightly more due to how cgroups work). In general, expect that you should leave **some headroom** on your node. If you have a machine with 32 GB RAM and you allocate four Minecraft servers with 8 GB each (32 GB total), you might actually be at capacity once you include overhead – it’s wiser to only allocate perhaps 24–28 GB out of 32 to game servers and leave some for overhead and the OS. The Reddit user above suggests they reserve about 12 GB for a 16 GB allocation to avoid swapping ([I recently moved to pterodactyl and I've been noticing a high usage of ram : r/admincraft](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/o6w9qh/i_recently_moved_to_pterodactyl_and_ive_been/#:~:text=Ptero%20has%20significant%20RAM%20overhead,5GB)) ([I recently moved to pterodactyl and I've been noticing a high usage of ram : r/admincraft](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/o6w9qh/i_recently_moved_to_pterodactyl_and_ive_been/#:~:text=Ptero%20has%20significant%20RAM%20overhead,5GB)). The Docker CPU overhead is minimal (a few percent at most), but one thing to watch is **CPU pinning/limits**. Pterodactyl allows setting a CPU limit (% of a core or number of cores). If you set a limit like “200%” for a container, it means 2 cores worth of time. If a game is multi-threaded, you should allocate accordingly. There was a case (with *Barotrauma* server) where the user noticed the server only using 1 core at 100% and not more ([Poor performance when hosting server via Ptedoractyl (docker) · Issue #11483 · FakeFishGames/Barotrauma · GitHub](https://github.com/Regalis11/Barotrauma/issues/11483#:~:text=Something%20I%20have%20noticed%20is,half%20of%20only%20one%20core)) ([Poor performance when hosting server via Ptedoractyl (docker) · Issue #11483 · FakeFishGames/Barotrauma · GitHub](https://github.com/Regalis11/Barotrauma/issues/11483#:~:text=Something%20I%20have%20noticed%20is,half%20of%20only%20one%20core)) – likely because the egg’s default CPU limit was 100% (one core). After adjusting the limit in the panel (or setting no limit), the game could utilize more cores. So, **be mindful of the CPU limit setting on each server**; if left at default (0 = no limit in newer Pterodactyl versions, or a specific percent in older eggs), it could constrain performance. Leaving it unlimited lets the container use all host cores as needed, but in a shared environment you might want to enforce fair use.

**Panel Performance and Memory:** The Pterodactyl panel (being a Laravel PHP app) can consume a few hundred MB of RAM when in use. If you have many simultaneous logins or API calls (e.g. lots of players checking console output via the web UI), the PHP-FPM workers and Redis will need some memory. Typically, a 1 GB RAM VM is enough for the panel and database for moderate usage. With heavy usage (say dozens of people managing servers at once), consider 2+ GB and offloading MySQL to its own service if necessary. The panel uses websockets (via an internal Nodejs or Go socket server) to push console logs – by default it uses **Socket.io** with a Nodejs gateway or can use a built-in SSE fallback. Ensure you’ve configured the **Websocket** correctly (either using Pterodactyl’s included `wsp` process or via a websocket proxy). Misconfigured websockets can cause higher load or slow console updates, but that’s more of a setup detail than a scaling issue.

**Scalability Limits:** Most practical limits come from the database and network: if you had thousands of servers, the panel’s database might become large (each server has records for console logs, allocations, etc.). Using proper indexing and cleaning up old records (like disabling or limiting the size of Wings logs in the panel) can help. Also, Wings communicates regularly with the panel (heartbeat, stats every few seconds for each server). If you have hundreds of servers per node reporting stats, the panel will be handling many incoming requests. This is usually fine (they’re lightweight), but extremely large scales might necessitate tuning the refresh intervals. At the extreme end, some users integrate Pterodactyl with Kubernetes (there’s an unofficial effort to have Pterodactyl deploy to k8s clusters) ([Kubernetes support · Issue #4406 · pterodactyl/panel - GitHub](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/issues/4406#:~:text=Kubernetes%20support%20%C2%B7%20Issue%20,)), but that’s beyond typical use.

**Potential Bottlenecks & Issues:**  
- **Network I/O and Ports:** If you host many servers on one machine, ensure the network can handle it. Each active player uses bandwidth; if your provider limits you to, say, 1 Gbps, that’s roughly 125 MB/s – plenty for hundreds of game clients (most games use only a few tens of Kbps per client). Port exhaustion is not usually an issue since you can have many ports, but make sure to allocate unique ports for each server service (Pterodactyl won’t let you conflict).  
- **Disk I/O and Space:** With many servers, especially Minecraft with large worlds or servers that generate lots of logs, storage performance and capacity matter. Use fast SSD/NVMe to avoid lag during disk-intensive operations (backups, world saves). Pterodactyl provides a per-server backup feature – storing many backups on the same disk can fill it up and also cause heavy I/O during compression. It may be wise to offload backups (Pterodactyl can send backups to external S3 storage in newer versions).  
- **One Node Down = Panel Delay:** A known limitation is if one Wings node is offline, the panel may hang or slow down when you navigate to that node’s data (because it tries to reach it). An issue was reported that *“if one of the nodes goes offline, the panel will slow down and sometimes throw 502 errors”* ([Panel will slow down drastically if one node is down #3936 - GitHub](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/issues/3936#:~:text=Panel%20will%20slow%20down%20drastically,errors%20every%20now%20and%20than)). This is because the panel waits on requests to the downed Wings. Thus, if you have multiple nodes and one crashes, expect the panel UI sections related to it (e.g. listing its servers) to timeout slowly. This doesn’t affect other nodes’ operations, but it’s something to be aware of when scaling multi-node – there isn’t an automatic removal of an offline node’s queries. Admins should manually mark nodes offline in the panel if performing maintenance to avoid slow queries.  
- **Automatic Scaling:** Pterodactyl is not an auto-scaler. If a node is full, you must manually deploy new nodes and move some servers to them (the panel can’t yet live-migrate a running container to another node; you’d have to schedule downtime, transfer files, and re-create the server on a new node). So planning capacity is important. A single Wings instance (node) can handle many containers – Docker can run hundreds, but your hardware (CPU/RAM) will cap it. For example, running 100 Minecraft servers on one machine is possible if it’s a beefy machine and many are empty or small, but not advisable for active servers due to resource contention. In such cases, splitting across multiple nodes is better for reliability.

**Conclusion (Performance):** Pterodactyl is quite efficient for what it does – it leverages Docker to isolate environments with minimal overhead. *Scalability* is achieved by adding more nodes; the panel can manage large fleets, but keep the single-panel nature in mind. The main limitations to watch are **memory overhead** (leave some RAM for Docker overhead and the OS) ([I recently moved to pterodactyl and I've been noticing a high usage of ram : r/admincraft](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/o6w9qh/i_recently_moved_to_pterodactyl_and_ive_been/#:~:text=Ptero%20has%20significant%20RAM%20overhead,5GB)), **CPU pinning settings** (ensure games aren’t accidentally constrained to too few cores unless intended) ([Poor performance when hosting server via Ptedoractyl (docker) · Issue #11483 · FakeFishGames/Barotrauma · GitHub](https://github.com/Regalis11/Barotrauma/issues/11483#:~:text=Something%20I%20have%20noticed%20is,half%20of%20only%20one%20core)), and the general fact that all your servers are still limited by the underlying hardware resources. Also, maintain your Wings and Panel versions – performance improvements and bug fixes (for CPU reporting, etc.) are frequent. By following best practices – enabling swap on the host (so a sudden RAM spike doesn’t kill a container) ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=On%20most%20systems%2C%20Docker%20will,near%20the%20bottom)), using proper limits to prevent any one server from hogging everything, and monitoring usage – you can host a large number of game servers under Pterodactyl reliably. Many game hosting providers have adopted Pterodactyl for its scalability and have demonstrated that it can run *hundreds of concurrent game instances* smoothly as long as the infrastructure underneath is robust.
