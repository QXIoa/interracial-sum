**Game Server Hosting with Pterodactyl Panel**  
Pterodactyl is a free, open-source game server management panel built with PHP (Laravel), React, and Go. It uses Docker containers to isolate game servers, providing enhanced security and resource control ([Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/#:~:text=Pterodactyl%C2%AE%20is%20a%20free%2C%20open,intuitive%20UI%20to%20end%20users)). With Pterodactyl, users get a modern web-based interface for starting, stopping, and monitoring game servers (CPU/RAM usage, console logs, file management, etc.) across one or many host machines. This report covers best practices for installing Pterodactyl on VPS or dedicated servers, compares popular cloud hosting providers for running Pterodactyl game servers, outlines which games are commonly hosted (and how they are supported via “eggs”), and discusses performance considerations (scalability, panel overhead, and resource allocation).

## 1. Setting Up Pterodactyl on VPS and Dedicated Servers  
**Choose a Supported OS and Environment:** Pterodactyl supports Ubuntu 20.04+ (including 22.04, 24.04), Debian 11/12, and Rocky/AlmaLinux 8/9 as base OS options ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=Operating%20System%20Version%20Supported%20Notes,Debian%2011%20%E2%9C%85%2012%20%E2%9C%85)). The official documentation uses Ubuntu 20.04 in examples, but any modern Linux distro with systemd will work. *Avoid OpenVZ/LXC-based VPS containers*, as they often lack proper Docker support – Pterodactyl’s Wings (daemon) **requires** a host that supports Docker (KVM or bare metal is recommended) ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=WARNING)) ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=To%20run%20Wings%2C%20you%20will,but%20there%20are%20edge%20cases)). For instance, OpenVZ virtualization is usually incompatible with Docker and will likely fail ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=WARNING)). Using a fresh server install is best practice to prevent conflicts; ensure you have root SSH access.

**Install Required Dependencies:** On the **Panel** server, you’ll need a LAMP/LEMP stack and associated packages: **PHP 8.2+** (with extensions: `cli`, `openssl`, `gd`, `mysql` (PDO), `mbstring`, `tokenizer`, `bcmath`, `xml`, `curl`, `zip`, and `fpm` for Nginx) ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=,%60tar)), **MySQL 8.0+** or MariaDB 10.2+, **Redis**, a web server (Apache or Nginx), **Git**, **curl**, **unzip**, and **Composer** (PHP dependency manager) ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=,%60tar)) ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=%23%20Install%20Dependencies%20apt%20,server)). The official documentation provides example commands for Ubuntu to add the PHP repository (ondrej/php), install MariaDB/Redis, etc ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=%23%20Add%20%22add,certificates%20gnupg)) ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=%23%20Install%20Dependencies%20apt%20,server)). On each **Wings node** (the server that actually runs game servers), the key requirement is **Docker CE**. You can install Docker via the official script: `curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | CHANNEL=stable bash` ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=)), then enable it to start on boot (`systemctl enable --now docker`). Ensure the Linux kernel supports Docker features; some hosts use custom kernels that disable memory cgroups, so verify with `docker info` (look for “WARNING: No swap limit support”) ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=Check%20your%20Kernel)) ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=On%20most%20systems%2C%20Docker%20will,near%20the%20bottom)). Pterodactyl recommends enabling swap accounting (adding `swapaccount=1` to the kernel line in GRUB and rebooting) so that Docker containers can use swap if needed, preventing out-of-memory crashes when a game server exceeds its RAM limit ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=On%20most%20systems%2C%20Docker%20will,near%20the%20bottom)).

**Panel Installation and Configuration:** It’s advised to install the Pterodactyl panel on a separate VPS or on a manager node (especially if you run a hosting business), but it can coexist with a game node on the same machine for small setups. Download the panel files (from the official GitHub release or using `curl` per docs), then run the installer commands (`php artisan p:environment:setup` to configure database credentials and URL, `php artisan migrate --seed` to set up the database, and `php artisan p:user:make` to create the first admin user) ([Getting started with Pterodactyl Panel - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-pterodactyl-panel/#:~:text=php%20artisan%20p%3Aenvironment%3Asetup%20php%20artisan,p%3Aenvironment%3Adatabase)) ([Getting started with Pterodactyl Panel - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-pterodactyl-panel/#:~:text=After%20the%20base%20data%2C%20you,run%20a%20few%20more%20commands)). Set file permissions for the web server user on `/var/www/pterodactyl` after installation ([Getting started with Pterodactyl Panel - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-pterodactyl-panel/#:~:text=php%20artisan%20p%3Auser%3Amake)). Next, configure the webserver: for example, set up an Nginx site pointing to the panel’s `public/` directory (the official docs provide configuration templates). Enable HTTPS for the panel domain – you can use Let’s Encrypt (Certbot) to obtain an SSL certificate ([Getting started with Pterodactyl Panel - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-pterodactyl-panel/#:~:text=SSL%20certificate%20setup)) ([Getting started with Pterodactyl Panel - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/getting-started-pterodactyl-panel/#:~:text=need%20to%20install%20Certbot%20via,the%20given%20command)), as running the panel over HTTPS is important for security. Once the panel is running, you can **add nodes** via the Admin UI (Nodes section). For each new node, you will install the Wings daemon on the target server and link it to the panel using the auto-generated configuration and secret token. *Note:* Make sure the panel URL is reachable from the nodes and their clocks are in sync (to avoid any JWT token issues). It’s possible (and common) to run multiple Wings nodes with one panel – e.g. you might have Node1, Node2, etc., each on different machines, all managed under the same panel ([multiple nodes, 1 panel : r/Pterodactyl](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pterodactyl/comments/mgbqvn/multiple_nodes_1_panel/#:~:text=is%20it%20possible%20to%20run,if%20that%20makes%20sense)) ([multiple nodes, 1 panel : r/Pterodactyl](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pterodactyl/comments/mgbqvn/multiple_nodes_1_panel/#:~:text=,as%20an%20additional%20wings%20daemon)). The main consideration is to configure each node with the correct **panel API endpoint and SSL settings** (all nodes and panel should use either valid SSL or none; mixing SSL vs non-SSL in config will cause connection failures) ([multiple nodes, 1 panel : r/Pterodactyl](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pterodactyl/comments/mgbqvn/multiple_nodes_1_panel/#:~:text=Is%20this%20possible%3F)).

**Best Practices:**  
- **Use Latest Versions:** Follow the latest Pterodactyl release (1.x); panel and Wings versions must match. Update regularly for security patches.  
- **Isolate Panel from Game Load:** For better reliability, host the panel (PHP application and MySQL DB) on a separate small VPS or cloud instance. This way, high game server load on a node won’t slow down the web UI. The panel itself is lightweight (can run on 1 core, 1-2 GB RAM) but the database should be tuned if you manage hundreds of servers.  
- **Configure Queue Workers:** Pterodactyl offloads tasks like sending emails and processing server events to a background queue. Ensure you set up the queue worker (a systemd service running `php artisan queue:work`) as per docs ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=)) ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=Description%3DPterodactyl%20Queue%20Worker%20After%3Dredis)). This improves performance by handling installs, backups, and notifications asynchronously.  
- **Firewall and Ports:** Open/forward the necessary ports. By default, Wings uses port 8080 or 443 for its API (configurable) and 2022 for SFTP. Game servers will each need an allocation (port) set in the panel. If running behind Cloudflare or a proxy, see the docs for WebSocket configuration and daemon port changes (e.g., use 8443 for Wings behind Cloudflare) ([Running Pterodactyl behind Cloudflare's proxy | by Mark David](https://markd123.medium.com/running-pterodactyl-behind-cloudflares-proxy-964e9545a31d#:~:text=Running%20Pterodactyl%20behind%20Cloudflare%27s%20proxy,Visit%20your%20Pterodactyl%20wings)).  
- **Security:** Run the panel as an unprivileged user (web server user) and Wings as root (since it manages Docker). Keep your system and Docker up to date. It’s recommended to enable UFW/iptables and allow only needed ports (panel HTTPS, Wings daemon, SFTP, game ports). Also, the panel can generate **per-server MySQL databases** if you configure a database host in the Admin -> Databases section ([Configuring your Node Database | A Gamers Grind / XFGN / LM](https://docs.agamersgrind.com/guides/pterodactyl/configuring-your-database#:~:text=Configuring%20your%20Node%20Database%20,the%20left%2C%20click%20on%20Databases)) – for this, provide a MySQL user with privileges to create databases, or use an external DB server.  

## 2. Cloud Providers Comparison for Hosting Pterodactyl Servers  
Hosting Pterodactyl on a cloud VPS is very common. This section compares major providers – **DigitalOcean, Linode (Akamai), Vultr, Hetzner, OVH** (mid-tier cloud/VPS providers) – and the big **hyperclouds (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)** on key factors: pricing, performance, network quality, Docker support, and ease of setup.

**Pricing and Specs:** The table below shows a sample VM configuration (around 2 vCPUs and 4 GB RAM, suitable for hosting a few game servers) on each provider and its approximate cost:

| Provider             | Sample Instance (2 vCPU, ~4 GB)                             | Hourly Price       | Monthly Price       |

**Notes:** Prices above are for **on-demand Linux VMs** in USD, using each provider’s closest plan (as of early 2025). *DigitalOcean, Linode, and Vultr* have straightforward pricing (bandwidth included, charges only if you exceed limits). *Hetzner* offers by far the best price-to-spec (a 4 GB cloud VM for under $5), but their data centers are primarily in Europe (and recently the US) – great for EU users and anyone on a budget ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=But%20that%20comes%20with%20a,a%20much%20lower%20cost%20price)) ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=The%20situation%20is%20completely%20different,of%20technical%20performance%20and%20price)). *OVH* provides very affordable VPS and specialized “Game” dedicated servers; their VPS Essential 4GB is about $11, and their higher tiers scale up to 8 vCores, 16 GB for under $20 ([Low-Cost, High-Performance VPS | Starter VPS | OVHcloud Worldwide](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/vps/cheap-vps/#:~:text=VPS%20solutions%20that%20adapt%20to,4%20to%208%20GB%20RAM)). AWS Lightsail is Amazon’s simplified VPS offering with flat pricing similar to DigitalOcean (e.g. $20 for 4GB) ([Free Cloud Server - Free Lightsail - AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/compute/lightsail/#:~:text=Free%20Cloud%20Server%20,16%20GB%20%C2%B7%204%20vCPU)). Standard AWS EC2 instances cost more (around $50+ monthly for a modest VM) ([DigitalOcean vs Vultr vs Akamai/Linode vs Hetzner vs AWS vs ...](https://spinupwp.com/blog/digitalocean-vs-google-cloud-vs-aws/#:~:text=DigitalOcean%20vs%20Vultr%20vs%20Akamai%2FLinode,42%2Fmo)), and GCP/Azure are in a similar or higher range (GCP often slightly higher than AWS for comparable VMs ([DigitalOcean vs Vultr vs Akamai/Linode vs Hetzner vs AWS vs Google Cloud](https://spinupwp.com/blog/digitalocean-vs-google-cloud-vs-aws/#:~:text=Performance,wise%2C%20at%20only%20%2410%2Fmonth))). Note that all cloud providers also charge for additional storage or bandwidth if you go beyond the plan’s included amount (AWS/GCP in particular have separate bandwidth charges, whereas others include a few TB).

**Performance (CPU, RAM, Disk I/O):** Not all vCPUs are equal – CPU clock speeds and contention differ. In independent benchmarks, **Hetzner** consistently ranks at or near the top in raw performance for similar VM sizes, often leading in multi-core and memory throughput tests ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=The%20situation%20is%20completely%20different,of%20technical%20performance%20and%20price)) ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=In%20the%20Apache%20benchmark%2C%20Hetzner%2C,RAM%20memory)). For example, in one January 2024 benchmark of 4 vCPU VMs, Hetzner was the *“big winner… in terms of technical performance and price”*, leading the pack in CPU (7-zip) and memory (STREAM) tests ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=The%20situation%20is%20completely%20different,of%20technical%20performance%20and%20price)). **Vultr** is known for its High Frequency plans with fast CPUs (3.8+ GHz Ryzen/Intel chips and NVMe SSDs), which showed strong memory and CPU performance as well (Vultr placed among top 3 in certain CPU tests and had excellent memory bandwidth results) ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=benchmark%20failed%20time%20and%20time,no%20results%20could%20be%20achieved)) ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=In%20the%20Apache%20benchmark%2C%20Hetzner%2C,RAM%20memory)). **DigitalOcean** and **Linode** use a mix of Intel and AMD processors; their performance is solid, but in price-to-performance they can be a bit behind Hetzner. In the same benchmarks, DO and Linode were described as *“very expensive”* for the performance delivered, whereas Hetzner offered similar or better performance at a fraction of the cost ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=Price,a%20lot%20for%20the%20price)) ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=especially%20earns%20a%20lot%20of,RAM%20memory)). It’s worth noting Linode’s tested plan had half the RAM in one scenario (8GB vs others’ 16GB) which affected some results ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=Note%3A%20the%20Linode%20server%20only,had%208%20GB%20of%20ram)), but generally Linode and DO are roughly on par with each other (both emphasize balanced, reliable performance over raw speed). **OVHcloud’s** public cloud VMs have somewhat inconsistent performance – one test noted an OVH instance *failed to complete* a certain Apache benchmark and “scored very low” in others ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=Vultr%20was%20in%20the%20middle,no%20results%20could%20be%20achieved)). This suggests OVH’s cloud instances might use older CPUs or have stricter throttling. However, OVH’s **dedicated Game servers** (not VMs but actual bare-metal machines) offer **top-end hardware** (e.g. latest-gen AMD EPYC CPUs with high single-core clocks, DDR5 RAM, NVMe) for demanding workloads ([Game-1 Dedicated Server](https://us.ovhcloud.com/bare-metal/game/game-1/#:~:text=Get%20world,data%20access%20and%20smooth%20gameplay)). Those are essentially dedicated servers and can run dozens of game servers without the virtualization overhead. **Disk I/O** on providers like DO, Vultr, and Linode is generally fast (all offer SSDs, and many now use NVMe SSDs for higher IOPS). In fact, DigitalOcean upgraded to NVMe storage on their premium droplets, and Linode/Akamai has rolled out NVMe on all block storage as well ([Linode has the Fastest NVMe Storage Around | Akamai](https://www.linode.com/content/linode-has-the-fastest-nvme-based-block-storage-among-all-cloud-providers/#:~:text=Linode%20has%20the%20Fastest%20NVMe,read%20performance%2C%20random%20read)). One community comparison found DO’s NVMe-based volumes about *10–20% faster* than Linode’s older SSDs in benchmarks ([Linode vs Digital Ocean Comparison : r/webdev - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/17w8o6d/linode_vs_digital_ocean_comparison/#:~:text=But%20in%20the%20benchmarks%20I%27ve,you%20choose%20NVMe%20you)), but Linode has since introduced NVMe in 2023 ([Linode has the Fastest NVMe Storage Around | Akamai](https://www.linode.com/content/linode-has-the-fastest-nvme-based-block-storage-among-all-cloud-providers/#:~:text=Linode%20has%20the%20Fastest%20NVMe,read%20performance%2C%20random%20read)). For most game servers (which aren’t extremely I/O heavy, except maybe for Minecraft world saves or ARK backups), the disk performance on these providers is more than sufficient. Hetzner’s storage also performs well (one test showed **Scaleway** and Hetzner leading in disk throughput, with Scaleway far ahead in a specific storage benchmark, but Scaleway was much pricier) ([Benchmark between cloud servers (January 2024)](https://techblog.nexxwave.eu/benchmark-between-cloud-servers-january-2024/#:~:text=Vultr%20and%20Scaleway%20are%20the,leaves%20everyone%20else%20far%20behind)). In summary: *Hetzner and Vultr* offer the best raw performance per dollar for typical game server loads, *DO and Linode* provide reliable and consistent performance with easy scaling, *OVH* might lag in cloud VM performance but has unique high-performance bare-metal options, and *AWS/GCP/Azure* give you access to high-end instance types (even GPUs or 10Gb networking) at a much higher cost.

**Network Quality and DDoS Protection:** Network latency and stability are crucial for game hosting. All these providers have data centers in multiple regions, so you should choose a location close to your player base. **DigitalOcean** has 8+ regions (NYC, SF, Toronto, London, Frankfurt, Bangalore, Singapore, etc.) and a generally robust network with a 99.99% uptime SLA for droplets ([Linode vs DigitalOcean - Which is the #1 VPS provider in 2025](https://www.mamboserver.com/hosting/linode-vs-digitalocean/#:~:text=DigitalOcean%20offers%20an%20impressive%2099.99,based%20on%20an%20hourly%20rate)). **Linode** (now Akamai) similarly has many regions (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific); Linode’s SLA is 99.9% ([Linode vs DigitalOcean - Which is the #1 VPS provider in 2025](https://www.mamboserver.com/hosting/linode-vs-digitalocean/#:~:text=DigitalOcean%20offers%20an%20impressive%2099.99,based%20on%20an%20hourly%20rate)) and they’ve historically had slightly higher network latency in some comparisons. For example, one latency test showed DO with 47 ms vs Linode 51 ms to a given client, and DO had higher download throughput in that case ([Linode vs DigitalOcean - Which is the #1 VPS provider in 2025](https://www.mamboserver.com/hosting/linode-vs-digitalocean/#:~:text=Here%E2%80%99s%20a%20snippet%20of%20a,conducted%20between%20DigitalOcean%20and%20Linode)) – but such differences may vary by route and are usually minor. **Vultr** stands out by having one of the largest location footprints (20+ locations worldwide, including many in Asia/Australia where others might have 1-2). Vultr’s network is generally good; bandwidth caps are a bit lower (e.g. 3 TB on the 4GB plan vs 4 TB on DO/Linode), but you can purchase more. Vultr and DO include basic DDoS mitigation on their platforms, but it’s not specialized for game traffic. **OVH** is *notable for DDoS protection* – it’s a core feature of their services. OVH’s network can absorb very large attacks (they advertise mitigation up to 1.3 Tbps) ([Anti-DDoS Infrastructure - OVHcloud](https://us.ovhcloud.com/security/anti-ddos/#:~:text=Anti,3Tbps%20in%20size)). In particular, OVH’s **Game servers** come with “Game DDoS Protection,” which is tailored to filter game-specific traffic patterns (TCP/UDP protocols for popular games) in real time ([OVHcloud® US Launches Third-Generation Bare Metal Game Servers Featuring AMD EPYC 4004 Processors](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241204561607/en/OVHcloud-US-Launches-Third-Generation-Bare-Metal-Game-Servers-Featuring-AMD-EPYC-4004-Processors#:~:text=,support%20and%20safeguard%20game%20hosting)) ([Game-1 Dedicated Server](https://us.ovhcloud.com/bare-metal/game/game-1/#:~:text=,Service%20Level%20Agreement%20%28SLA)). Many game hosting companies use OVH dedicated servers in part for this strong anti-DDoS capability. OVH has data centers in Europe (France, UK, Germany) and North America (Beauharnois in Canada, Vint Hill in US-East, and a US-West site) – so coverage is decent, though not as extensive in Asia. **Hetzner**’s network is excellent in Europe (locations in Germany and Finland) and they launched a US East coast location in 2022. Hetzner includes generous traffic (20 TB, then throttled) and basic DDoS protection (they have mitigation systems, though not as specifically “game-tuned” as OVH’s) – for most users, Hetzner’s network is reliable and a *huge cost saver on bandwidth* compared to AWS/GCP, which charge for egress (Hetzner’s bandwidth fees beyond the generous free allotment are only a few € per TB, whereas “big cloud” can charge ~$90/TB if you exceed free tiers) ([Hetzner lowers pricing of Intel cloud servers | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40594817#:~:text=immibis%20%20%2067%20,next%20%5B%E2%80%93)) ([Hetzner lowers pricing of Intel cloud servers | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40594817#:~:text=leave%20offer%3F)). **AWS/GCP/Azure** have the most global regions and very high backbone quality. AWS and Google have private fiber networks connecting their regions and typically offer low latency connections worldwide (and services like AWS Global Accelerator or Cloudflare Spectrum can further optimize routing for gaming). However, by default an EC2 or GCE instance doesn’t include special DDoS protection beyond the standard infrastructure – Amazon does have **AWS Shield Advanced** and AWS Firewall Manager (at additional cost) which can mitigate large DDoS attacks, and Azure has **DDoS Protection Standard** service, etc. These can be expensive add-ons. Amazon Lightsail instances include a few TB of bandwidth (as noted above) and are simpler, but for massive attacks, a solution like OVH might still fare better out-of-the-box for a gaming context. To summarize networks: If you anticipate DDoS attacks (common in competitive games or public Minecraft servers), **OVH** is a top choice due to included protection ([OVHcloud® US Launches Third-Generation Bare Metal Game Servers Featuring AMD EPYC 4004 Processors](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241204561607/en/OVHcloud-US-Launches-Third-Generation-Bare-Metal-Game-Servers-Featuring-AMD-EPYC-4004-Processors#:~:text=,support%20and%20safeguard%20game%20hosting)). Others provide decent basic DDoS mitigation (volumetric attacks will usually be absorbed to some extent, but application-specific attacks might still cause lag). Latency-wise, pick a provider with a region near your players: DO, Linode, Vultr cover most continents; Hetzner is ideal for EU (and now US East); AWS/Azure/GCP have the widest reach if you need something like South America or Africa (though Azure and Oracle Cloud are options there). Also consider network throughput – e.g., OVH Game servers come with a full 1 Gbps port guaranteed ([OVHcloud® US Launches Third-Generation Bare Metal Game Servers Featuring AMD EPYC 4004 Processors](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241204561607/en/OVHcloud-US-Launches-Third-Generation-Bare-Metal-Game-Servers-Featuring-AMD-EPYC-4004-Processors#:~:text=,support%20and%20safeguard%20game%20hosting)), whereas VPS providers typically share a 1 Gbps port (you might effectively get 200–500 Mbps throughput in practice, which is plenty for dozens of players).

**Virtualization & Docker Support:** All the listed cloud providers use hypervisors (KVM, Xen, etc.) that fully support running Docker and systemd. This means you can deploy the Pterodactyl panel and Wings on any of these VPS instances without low-level compatibility issues. The only caution is with some very low-end providers or older “OpenVZ” based VPS plans (not usually the case with the major providers mentioned). As noted earlier, Pterodactyl will not run on OpenVZ 6 containers due to Docker restrictions ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=WARNING)). Providers like DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, Hetzner all use KVM virtualization for their VPS, so you have full control and can load custom kernel modules, etc. Running Docker is straightforward on these platforms – for example, DigitalOcean provides a one-click image with Docker pre-installed, and others have marketplace apps (though not specifically for Pterodactyl, you can find community scripts on GitHub that automate the panel installation on a fresh VPS). In short, **Docker and systemd are supported by default on all major cloud VMs**; you won’t face virtualization issues on DO/Linode/Vultr/Hetzner/AWS/GCP (they effectively behave like a normal Linux server) ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=To%20run%20Wings%2C%20you%20will,but%20there%20are%20edge%20cases)) ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=When%20your%20provider%20uses%20,KVM%20is%20guaranteed%20to%20work)). One thing to note is **nested virtualization**: if you ever tried to run a VM inside your VPS (not common for Pterodactyl usage), that might be disallowed. But running Docker, which uses OS-level virtualization, is fine. Also, ensure your kernel on the VM has necessary features (some providers like OVH allow custom kernels – if a custom kernel is used, make sure it has cgroup support for memory accounting, etc., otherwise Docker might show that swap limit or other cgroup features are unavailable ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=Check%20your%20Kernel))). Usually, using the distribution’s stock kernel (Ubuntu’s, etc.) on these cloud VMs is recommended.

**Ease of Setup and Management:** Developer-focused clouds like DigitalOcean, Linode, and Vultr are known for their simplicity. For a newcomer, **DigitalOcean**’s interface and documentation are very user-friendly – you can spin up a droplet in a couple of minutes, and DO has community tutorials (including for Pterodactyl installation). Linode’s dashboard is also straightforward, though a tad more utilitarian. Vultr offers a web console and even upload of ISO images if you want custom OS installs. All three have one-click app marketplaces; at the time of writing, Pterodactyl isn’t an official one-click, but there are community installation scripts (e.g. “Pterodactyl-installer” on GitHub) that work on these platforms. **Hetzner**’s cloud console is a bit less polished (it’s functional but not as pretty or intuitive as DO’s) – one review noted “their dashboard isn’t as nice as most others, but it gets the job done” ([DigitalOcean vs Vultr vs Akamai/Linode vs Hetzner vs AWS vs Google Cloud](https://spinupwp.com/blog/digitalocean-vs-google-cloud-vs-aws/#:~:text=match%20at%20L168%20offer%20a,it%20gets%20the%20job%20done)). Hetzner requires some comfort with setting up networking (their default images are minimal), but they do provide cloud-init and an API as well. **OVH** can be slightly more complicated to navigate; their US and EU panels differ, and deploying a VPS or dedicated server has a few more steps (OVH is more oriented towards experienced users). That said, once the server is up, installing Pterodactyl is the same process on any Ubuntu/Debian system. One issue to watch: OVH’s older VPS lines might have custom kernels (as mentioned) – if so, switching to a distro kernel can help Docker compatibility per Pterodactyl’s documentation ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=Check%20your%20Kernel)). **AWS and Google Cloud** are the most complex for beginners. AWS EC2 requires configuring VPC networks, security groups (firewall rules), keys, etc., which is overkill for a single game VM. The AWS console has a steep learning curve and many options that aren’t needed for a basic game server ([DigitalOcean vs Vultr vs Akamai/Linode vs Hetzner vs AWS vs Google Cloud](https://spinupwp.com/blog/digitalocean-vs-google-cloud-vs-aws/#:~:text=AWS%20provides%20a%20wide%20range,usage%2C%20depending%20on%20the%20service)) ([DigitalOcean vs Vultr vs Akamai/Linode vs Hetzner vs AWS vs Google Cloud](https://spinupwp.com/blog/digitalocean-vs-google-cloud-vs-aws/#:~:text=Check%20out%20our%20Amazon%20Lightsail,doc%20for%20more%20details)). **Amazon Lightsail**, however, was created to bridge this gap – Lightsail presents a simplified UI where you choose a plan (e.g. 4GB, $20), a region, and launch, similar to DO ([DigitalOcean vs Vultr vs Akamai/Linode vs Hetzner vs AWS vs Google Cloud](https://spinupwp.com/blog/digitalocean-vs-google-cloud-vs-aws/#:~:text=Enter%20Amazon%20Lightsail%2C%20which%20you,monthly%20cost%20for%20each%20server)). It even shows you the static IP and credentials, and allows quick setup without dealing with all of AWS’s networking intricacies. So for AWS, Lightsail is strongly recommended for Pterodactyl unless you specifically need an EC2 feature. **Google Cloud** is slightly more user-friendly than raw AWS – their Compute Engine lets you launch a VM via a wizard, but you might still have to open ports in the GCP firewall. Google’s pricing UI is not very transparent (you rely on a calculator estimate) ([DigitalOcean vs Vultr vs Akamai/Linode vs Hetzner vs AWS vs Google Cloud](https://spinupwp.com/blog/digitalocean-vs-google-cloud-vs-aws/#:~:text=Google%20Cloud%20is%20similar%20to,when%20deploying%20a%20VM%20instance)). **Azure** is also quite complex, with a large portal and sometimes confusing pricing for VM series. In summary, if ease of setup is a priority, **Lightsail or Vultr/DO/Linode** will give you the smoothest experience. In a recent comparison, developers concluded that *“Vultr, Hetzner, Akamai (Linode), and DigitalOcean all offer a refined, focused user experience that’s reliable and easy to set up,”* whereas AWS and GCP, while powerful, *“can be daunting to use”* without simplification layers ([DigitalOcean vs Vultr vs Akamai/Linode vs Hetzner vs AWS vs Google Cloud](https://spinupwp.com/blog/digitalocean-vs-google-cloud-vs-aws/#:~:text=simplicity%2C%20and%20pricing,and%20easy%20to%20set%20up)) ([DigitalOcean vs Vultr vs Akamai/Linode vs Hetzner vs AWS vs Google Cloud](https://spinupwp.com/blog/digitalocean-vs-google-cloud-vs-aws/#:~:text=With%20so%20many%20cloud%20providers,and%20easy%20to%20set%20up)). The Pterodactyl community is very active on Discord and forums, so whichever host you choose, you can likely find guides or help specific to that provider if needed.

## 3. Popular Games Hosted on Pterodactyl and Egg Support Levels  
Pterodactyl is capable of hosting practically any game server that can run on Linux (and even some that require Wine/Mono or custom environments). It uses a system of **“nests” and “eggs”** to define server configurations. An “egg” is essentially a pre-defined template for a game server, including the Docker image or startup script, default installation files, and variables (like max memory, world name, etc.). Pterodactyl’s core team maintains a set of **official eggs** for many common games, and the community contributes many others.

**Officially Supported (“Core”) Games:** According to the Pterodactyl documentation, core supported games include ([Introduction | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/project/introduction.html#supported-games#:~:text=Some%20of%20our%20core%20supported,games%20include)) ([Introduction | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/project/introduction.html#supported-games#:~:text=)): 

- **Minecraft** (Java Edition and forks) – *Eggs for Spigot/Paper, Sponge, Bungeecord/Waterfall proxies, Forge, etc. are included*. (Minecraft is by far one of the most hosted games on Pterodactyl.)  
- **Rust** – *Official egg available*.  
- **Terraria** – *Official egg*.  
- **TeamSpeak 3** – *Voice server egg*.  
- **Mumble** – *Voice server egg*.  
- **Team Fortress 2** – *Source engine dedicated server egg*.  
- **Counter-Strike: Global Offensive** – *Official egg (CS:GO server)*.  
- **Garry’s Mod** – *Official egg*.  
- **ARK: Survival Evolved** – *Official egg (this game is resource-heavy, but Pterodactyl can manage it with the provided egg using SteamCMD to install)*.

These official eggs are maintained in the primary **Pterodactyl/eggs** repository (sometimes referred to as the “standard” nest). They come bundled or can be imported easily. Having an official egg means that the game’s installation and startup parameters have been pre-configured by the Pterodactyl team, and they likely receive updates when the panel updates.

**Community and Custom Eggs:** Beyond the core list, the community has created eggs for dozens of other games and software. The documentation notes examples such as ([Introduction | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/project/introduction.html#supported-games#:~:text=provided%20by%20the%20community,of%20these%20games%20include)):

- **Factorio** – *community-provided egg*.  
- **San Andreas Multiplayer (SA:MP)** – *community egg*.  
- **PocketMine-MP (Minecraft Bedrock server)** – *community egg available*.  
- **Squad** – *community egg*.  
- **FiveM (GTA V multiplayer mod)** – *community egg (very popular for GTA communities)*.  
- **Xonotic** – *community egg*.  
- **Discord bots (e.g. ATLBot)** – *eggs for certain bot hosting environments*.

The community eggs were historically hosted in a repo called `parkervcp/eggs` or `community eggs` (recently read-only during a migration to a new system called “Pelican” panel eggs) ([Current list of supported games : r/Pterodactyl](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pterodactyl/comments/1d7oddz/current_list_of_supported_games/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)). Now, many eggs can be found on forums or the official Discord. Generally, if a game has a dedicated server binary for Linux, someone has likely made a Pterodactyl egg for it. For example, eggs exist for **Valheim**, **Outward**, **Barotrauma**, **Eco**, **Don't Starve Together**, **Project Zomboid**, **HLDS games (Counter-Strike 1.6, etc.)**, **Call of Duty 4**, **Battlefield** series via Wine, and more. The community has even provided eggs for non-game software like **pex** (BungeeCord proxies), **MongoDB**, **Jupyter Notebook** – though those are more edge cases of using Pterodactyl as a general container orchestrator.

- *Level of support:* **Official eggs** (like the Minecraft or CS:GO eggs) are generally well-tested and kept up to date with the panel. **Community eggs** might require specific Docker images or have quirks, but usually come with instructions. For instance, a FiveM egg might require you to agree to a license key from Cfx.re. Pterodactyl’s service daemon (Wings) will pull the required Docker image for an egg automatically – many eggs use generic images (like an Ubuntu base with dependencies). Some community eggs use custom Docker images (which are usually pulled from Docker Hub). If an egg isn’t available, you can always try to create your own: Pterodactyl allows custom launch parameters and startup scripts. This is a manual process and considered advanced, but the panel’s **“Creating a Custom Egg”** guide explains how to package a game server that Pterodactyl doesn’t natively support ([Creating a Custom Egg - Pterodactyl Panel](https://pterodactyl.io/community/config/eggs/creating_a_custom_egg.html#:~:text=Creating%20a%20Custom%20Egg%20,in%20the%20egg%20startup%2C)). In the worst case, you could run the game server in a generic container with a bash shell – but then you lose the benefit of automation. The good news is that games like *Minecraft (Java and Bedrock), ARK, Rust, Valheim, CS:GO, Garry’s Mod, ARMA, etc.* all have readily available eggs either officially or via community. Even newer games usually get community support within weeks of release if there’s demand.

- *Egg status:* An **official egg** means it’s part of Pterodactyl’s standard set (often referred to as the “Packaged Egg” or default nest). These eggs are maintained by Pterodactyl staff – e.g. the Minecraft egg is included out-of-the-box. A **community egg** means you might have to import it. Importing an egg is done via the panel’s Eggs UI (upload the JSON file for the egg). This will create a new service option under a “nest” (category). The panel by default has nests like “Minecraft”, “Source Engine”, etc. Community eggs might instruct you to create a new nest or use an existing one. **Manual setup** (no egg) is rarely necessary unless the game is very uncommon or proprietary. But if needed, you can always start with a generic Linux egg and then install the server manually inside the container (similar to how you’d do on a normal server). This is not as integrated (the panel wouldn’t know how to automatically update or start it without you configuring that), so creating a custom egg is preferred for repeatability.

In summary, **Minecraft** (all variants) is fully supported with official eggs and is one of the most common uses of Pterodactyl. Other big titles like **Rust, ARK, CS:GO, GMod, TF2, etc.** are officially supported as well ([Introduction | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/project/introduction.html#supported-games#:~:text=Some%20of%20our%20core%20supported,games%20include)). The community extends support to dozens more games – check the Pterodactyl eggs repository or community listings for a full list. Virtually any game server that can run on a Linux machine can be run under Pterodactyl, it’s mainly a question of whether an egg recipe is available or if you need to script the startup yourself.

## 4. Pterodactyl Performance Considerations and Limitations  
While Pterodactyl makes managing game servers much easier, it’s important to understand its performance overhead and design limits to scale effectively.

**Panel & Daemon Architecture:** Pterodactyl has a central **Panel** (web UI and API, backed by a MySQL database and Redis queue) and one or more **Wings** daemons (which run on each node to manage containers). The panel itself is not very CPU-intensive; it mostly handles user requests and orchestrates tasks via the queue. Even a modest VM can handle dozens or hundreds of server entries in the database. The heavier work happens on the Wings side: starting/stopping servers (spawning Docker containers), executing install scripts, and funneling console output and stats back to the panel (Wings sends websocket updates for server status and resource usage).

**Concurrent Server Management:** Pterodactyl’s workflow is queue-driven. Actions like installing a server or performing automated backups are queued and processed sequentially by default ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=We%20make%20use%20of%20queues,setup%20the%20queue%20worker%20for)) ([Getting Started | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/getting_started.html#:~:text=ExecStart%3D%2Fusr%2Fbin%2Fphp%20%2Fvar%2Fwww%2Fpterodactyl%2Fartisan%20queue%3Awork%20,tries%3D3%20StartLimitInterval%3D180%20StartLimitBurst%3D30)). This means if you trigger many actions at once (e.g. boot 50 servers simultaneously), the panel won’t overload the system by doing all in parallel – it will process through them, a few at a time (you can configure multiple queue workers for higher concurrency if needed). Starting and stopping servers are fairly lightweight (Docker can spin up containers quickly), but if all your servers launch at the exact same time (for example, after a power node reboot), there could be a short burst of high CPU/disk as all Docker containers initialize. In practice, most users stagger their servers or start only what’s needed. **Scalability:** There are installations of Pterodactyl managing hundreds of game servers across multiple nodes. The design is horizontally scalable: you can add as many Wings nodes as required, and the panel will just see more “allocations” to deploy to. The panel isn’t (currently) clustered – you can’t have multiple panel instances sharing one DB for load-balancing, so typically one panel instance is used. If it becomes a bottleneck, one can scale the panel vertically (give it a stronger DB server or more PHP workers). For very large communities, running the MySQL database on a dedicated machine and enabling Redis caching is recommended. Also, Pterodactyl’s panel supports Redis-based caching and session storage, which improve performance when many users are accessing the UI simultaneously.

**Resource Overhead of Docker:** Since each game server runs in a Docker container, there is a slight overhead compared to running all servers directly on the host. This overhead is mostly in memory and some CPU due to container isolation. For example, one user reported that **each Docker container used by Pterodactyl had a notable RAM overhead** – in their case, a Minecraft server given 16 GB would use about 14.5 GB in-game with ~1.5-2 GB overhead from Docker/Pterodactyl ([I recently moved to pterodactyl and I've been noticing a high usage of ram : r/admincraft](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/o6w9qh/i_recently_moved_to_pterodactyl_and_ive_been/#:~:text=Ptero%20has%20significant%20RAM%20overhead,5GB)). This overhead can include the base OS libraries, the JVM overhead outside the heap, and cgroup accounting. Pterodactyl’s Wings will always allocate the full memory limit to the container (e.g., a server with “4096 MB” limit will have a cgroup limit of 4GB; the game may not use it all, but the container itself might show slightly more due to how cgroups work). In general, expect that you should leave **some headroom** on your node. If you have a machine with 32 GB RAM and you allocate four Minecraft servers with 8 GB each (32 GB total), you might actually be at capacity once you include overhead – it’s wiser to only allocate perhaps 24–28 GB out of 32 to game servers and leave some for overhead and the OS. The Reddit user above suggests they reserve about 12 GB for a 16 GB allocation to avoid swapping ([I recently moved to pterodactyl and I've been noticing a high usage of ram : r/admincraft](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/o6w9qh/i_recently_moved_to_pterodactyl_and_ive_been/#:~:text=Ptero%20has%20significant%20RAM%20overhead,5GB)) ([I recently moved to pterodactyl and I've been noticing a high usage of ram : r/admincraft](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/o6w9qh/i_recently_moved_to_pterodactyl_and_ive_been/#:~:text=Ptero%20has%20significant%20RAM%20overhead,5GB)). The Docker CPU overhead is minimal (a few percent at most), but one thing to watch is **CPU pinning/limits**. Pterodactyl allows setting a CPU limit (% of a core or number of cores). If you set a limit like “200%” for a container, it means 2 cores worth of time. If a game is multi-threaded, you should allocate accordingly. There was a case (with *Barotrauma* server) where the user noticed the server only using 1 core at 100% and not more ([Poor performance when hosting server via Ptedoractyl (docker) · Issue #11483 · FakeFishGames/Barotrauma · GitHub](https://github.com/Regalis11/Barotrauma/issues/11483#:~:text=Something%20I%20have%20noticed%20is,half%20of%20only%20one%20core)) ([Poor performance when hosting server via Ptedoractyl (docker) · Issue #11483 · FakeFishGames/Barotrauma · GitHub](https://github.com/Regalis11/Barotrauma/issues/11483#:~:text=Something%20I%20have%20noticed%20is,half%20of%20only%20one%20core)) – likely because the egg’s default CPU limit was 100% (one core). After adjusting the limit in the panel (or setting no limit), the game could utilize more cores. So, **be mindful of the CPU limit setting on each server**; if left at default (0 = no limit in newer Pterodactyl versions, or a specific percent in older eggs), it could constrain performance. Leaving it unlimited lets the container use all host cores as needed, but in a shared environment you might want to enforce fair use.

**Panel Performance and Memory:** The Pterodactyl panel (being a Laravel PHP app) can consume a few hundred MB of RAM when in use. If you have many simultaneous logins or API calls (e.g. lots of players checking console output via the web UI), the PHP-FPM workers and Redis will need some memory. Typically, a 1 GB RAM VM is enough for the panel and database for moderate usage. With heavy usage (say dozens of people managing servers at once), consider 2+ GB and offloading MySQL to its own service if necessary. The panel uses websockets (via an internal Nodejs or Go socket server) to push console logs – by default it uses **Socket.io** with a Nodejs gateway or can use a built-in SSE fallback. Ensure you’ve configured the **Websocket** correctly (either using Pterodactyl’s included `wsp` process or via a websocket proxy). Misconfigured websockets can cause higher load or slow console updates, but that’s more of a setup detail than a scaling issue.

**Scalability Limits:** Most practical limits come from the database and network: if you had thousands of servers, the panel’s database might become large (each server has records for console logs, allocations, etc.). Using proper indexing and cleaning up old records (like disabling or limiting the size of Wings logs in the panel) can help. Also, Wings communicates regularly with the panel (heartbeat, stats every few seconds for each server). If you have hundreds of servers per node reporting stats, the panel will be handling many incoming requests. This is usually fine (they’re lightweight), but extremely large scales might necessitate tuning the refresh intervals. At the extreme end, some users integrate Pterodactyl with Kubernetes (there’s an unofficial effort to have Pterodactyl deploy to k8s clusters) ([Kubernetes support · Issue #4406 · pterodactyl/panel - GitHub](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/issues/4406#:~:text=Kubernetes%20support%20%C2%B7%20Issue%20,)), but that’s beyond typical use.

**Potential Bottlenecks & Issues:**  
- **Network I/O and Ports:** If you host many servers on one machine, ensure the network can handle it. Each active player uses bandwidth; if your provider limits you to, say, 1 Gbps, that’s roughly 125 MB/s – plenty for hundreds of game clients (most games use only a few tens of Kbps per client). Port exhaustion is not usually an issue since you can have many ports, but make sure to allocate unique ports for each server service (Pterodactyl won’t let you conflict).  
- **Disk I/O and Space:** With many servers, especially Minecraft with large worlds or servers that generate lots of logs, storage performance and capacity matter. Use fast SSD/NVMe to avoid lag during disk-intensive operations (backups, world saves). Pterodactyl provides a per-server backup feature – storing many backups on the same disk can fill it up and also cause heavy I/O during compression. It may be wise to offload backups (Pterodactyl can send backups to external S3 storage in newer versions).  
- **One Node Down = Panel Delay:** A known limitation is if one Wings node is offline, the panel may hang or slow down when you navigate to that node’s data (because it tries to reach it). An issue was reported that *“if one of the nodes goes offline, the panel will slow down and sometimes throw 502 errors”* ([Panel will slow down drastically if one node is down #3936 - GitHub](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/issues/3936#:~:text=Panel%20will%20slow%20down%20drastically,errors%20every%20now%20and%20than)). This is because the panel waits on requests to the downed Wings. Thus, if you have multiple nodes and one crashes, expect the panel UI sections related to it (e.g. listing its servers) to timeout slowly. This doesn’t affect other nodes’ operations, but it’s something to be aware of when scaling multi-node – there isn’t an automatic removal of an offline node’s queries. Admins should manually mark nodes offline in the panel if performing maintenance to avoid slow queries.  
- **Automatic Scaling:** Pterodactyl is not an auto-scaler. If a node is full, you must manually deploy new nodes and move some servers to them (the panel can’t yet live-migrate a running container to another node; you’d have to schedule downtime, transfer files, and re-create the server on a new node). So planning capacity is important. A single Wings instance (node) can handle many containers – Docker can run hundreds, but your hardware (CPU/RAM) will cap it. For example, running 100 Minecraft servers on one machine is possible if it’s a beefy machine and many are empty or small, but not advisable for active servers due to resource contention. In such cases, splitting across multiple nodes is better for reliability.

**Conclusion (Performance):** Pterodactyl is quite efficient for what it does – it leverages Docker to isolate environments with minimal overhead. *Scalability* is achieved by adding more nodes; the panel can manage large fleets, but keep the single-panel nature in mind. The main limitations to watch are **memory overhead** (leave some RAM for Docker overhead and the OS) ([I recently moved to pterodactyl and I've been noticing a high usage of ram : r/admincraft](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/o6w9qh/i_recently_moved_to_pterodactyl_and_ive_been/#:~:text=Ptero%20has%20significant%20RAM%20overhead,5GB)), **CPU pinning settings** (ensure games aren’t accidentally constrained to too few cores unless intended) ([Poor performance when hosting server via Ptedoractyl (docker) · Issue #11483 · FakeFishGames/Barotrauma · GitHub](https://github.com/Regalis11/Barotrauma/issues/11483#:~:text=Something%20I%20have%20noticed%20is,half%20of%20only%20one%20core)), and the general fact that all your servers are still limited by the underlying hardware resources. Also, maintain your Wings and Panel versions – performance improvements and bug fixes (for CPU reporting, etc.) are frequent. By following best practices – enabling swap on the host (so a sudden RAM spike doesn’t kill a container) ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=On%20most%20systems%2C%20Docker%20will,near%20the%20bottom)), using proper limits to prevent any one server from hogging everything, and monitoring usage – you can host a large number of game servers under Pterodactyl reliably. Many game hosting providers have adopted Pterodactyl for its scalability and have demonstrated that it can run *hundreds of concurrent game instances* smoothly as long as the infrastructure underneath is robust.

# Further Information on Cloud Servers with Pterodactyl

Pterodactyl is an open-source game server management panel that lets you host game servers across one or more machines (“Wings” nodes) with a central web interface (the “Panel”). This guide covers three crucial aspects for setting up Pterodactyl in production: **(1)** choosing a suitable server (VPS or dedicated) from popular cloud providers, **(2)** configuring domains and subdomains for your panel and nodes, and **(3)** securing your installation with Let’s Encrypt SSL certificates. We’ll provide detailed information, best practices, and step-by-step instructions, complete with references to official documentation and community guides.

## 1. Choosing a Cloud Server Provider (VPS vs Dedicated)

When hosting Pterodactyl, you need a Linux server (virtual or bare-metal) that supports Docker containers (required by the Wings daemon) ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=To%20run%20Wings%2C%20you%20will,but%20there%20are%20edge%20cases)). Most VPS plans and dedicated servers meet this requirement, **but avoid providers using container-based virtualization** (like OpenVZ/LXC) unless they explicitly support nesting Docker ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=but%20there%20are%20edge%20cases)). KVM-based VMs or physical servers are recommended for full compatibility ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=When%20your%20provider%20uses%20,KVM%20is%20guaranteed%20to%20work)). Below we compare popular cloud providers – their VPS offerings, dedicated server options, hardware specs, virtualization, data centers, and pricing:

### DigitalOcean (Cloud VPS)
- **Services:** Scalable cloud **Droplets** (virtual machines) running on KVM ([Does DigitalOcean support KVM or nested virtulzation ? | DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/does-digitalocean-support-kvm-or-nested-virtulzation#:~:text=Currently%2C%20DigitalOcean%20Droplets%20support%20KVM,is%20normally%20the%20better%20option)). Fully supports Docker and Pterodactyl Wings out of the box. No dedicated/bare-metal offering (Droplets only).
- **Specs:** Droplets come in Standard (shared CPU), Premium (NVMe SSD, latest CPUs), or Optimized tiers. Basic plans range from **1 vCPU / 1 GB RAM / 25 GB SSD** up to **32 vCPU / 256 GB RAM / 7 TB SSD** (plus larger memory-optimized flavors) ([Droplet Pricing | DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets#:~:text=Started%20cloud,00Get%20Started)) ([Droplet Pricing | DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets#:~:text=32%20GiB%2016%20vCPUs%207%2C000,GiB)). All use fast SSD storage (NVMe on premium plans) and include a free outbound bandwidth quota per month.
- **Bandwidth:** **Transfer allowances** scale with plan size (e.g. ~1 TB on a 1 GB droplet, 4–11 TB on larger plans) ([Droplet Pricing | DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets#:~:text=Started%20cloud,00Get%20Started)) ([Droplet Pricing | DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets#:~:text=32%20GiB%2016%20vCPUs%207%2C000,GiB)). Additional outgoing traffic is billed at about **$0.01 per GB** ([Droplet Pricing | DigitalOcean Documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/details/pricing/#:~:text=Droplet%20Pricing%20,transfer%20to%20Droplets%20is)). Inbound traffic is free.
- **Regions:** Data centers across North America, Europe, and Asia. For example, New York (NYC), San Francisco (SFO), Toronto, London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Bangalore, and Singapore.
- **Pricing:** Simple and predictable. A **1 GB/1 vCPU Droplet** is \$6.00/month (or ~$0.00893/hour) ([Droplet Pricing | DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets#:~:text=Started%20cloud,00Get%20Started)). Smaller “Basic” Droplets start at **$4.00/month** for 0.5 GB RAM ([Droplet Pricing | DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets#:~:text=Memory%20vCPU%20Transfer%20SSD%24%2Fhr%24%2Fmo%20512,00%20127%20Get)). Higher plans scale linearly (e.g. 4 GB/2 vCPU for \$24/mo) ([Droplet Pricing | DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets#:~:text=2%20GiB%202%20vCPUs%203%2C000,00%20129%20Get)). Usage is billed hourly with monthly caps. **Official Pricing:** See DigitalOcean’s [Droplet pricing page】 ([Droplet Pricing | DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets#:~:text=Started%20cloud,00Get%20Started)) for full details.

### Linode (Cloud VPS by Akamai)
- **Services:** Developer-friendly cloud VMs similar to DigitalOcean. Uses **KVM** virtualization (switched from Xen in 2015) – supports Docker and Pterodactyl without issues ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=To%20run%20Wings%2C%20you%20will,but%20there%20are%20edge%20cases)). No bare-metal servers (cloud instances only).
- **Specs:** Standard plans (“Nanodes” and shared CPU plans) and Dedicated CPU plans. For example, the entry “Nanode” offers **1 vCPU / 1 GB RAM / 25 GB SSD** and 1 TB transfer ([DigitalOcean vs Linode | UpGuard](https://www.upguard.com/blog/digitalocean-vs-linode#:~:text=Linode%20can%20match%20the%20bargain,companies%E2%80%99%20provisions%2C%20the%20differences%20mostly)). Plans scale up to 32 vCPU / 192 GB RAM. All Linode instances now use fast NVMe SSD storage.
- **Bandwidth:** Generous included transfer (typically **1 TB** on the smallest plan, scaling upwards). Overages are billed at flat rates (Linode’s overage ~$0.01/GB, similar to others).
- **Regions:** Global data centers – e.g. Newark, Dallas, Atlanta, Fremont (USA); Toronto (Canada); London, Frankfurt (Europe); Singapore, Mumbai, Tokyo, Sydney (Asia-Pacific).
- **Pricing:** Competitive flat pricing, billed hourly. The **1 GB Nanode** is **\$5/month** (about \$0.0075/hour) ([DigitalOcean vs Linode | UpGuard](https://www.upguard.com/blog/digitalocean-vs-linode#:~:text=Linode%20can%20match%20the%20bargain,companies%E2%80%99%20provisions%2C%20the%20differences%20mostly)), matching DigitalOcean’s base plan. Higher tiers (e.g. 2 GB for \$10, 4 GB for \$20, etc.) follow the same pricing structure ([DigitalOcean vs Linode | UpGuard](https://www.upguard.com/blog/digitalocean-vs-linode#:~:text=Linode%20can%20match%20the%20bargain,companies%E2%80%99%20provisions%2C%20the%20differences%20mostly)). Linode includes a  Nanode for \$5 and a range of larger plans up to 192 GB. (New customers also get a $100 credit or similar promotions via Akamai.)

### Vultr (Cloud VPS + Bare Metal)
- **Services:** Cloud Compute instances with both **Standard** and **High Frequency** tiers, and optional bare-metal dedicated instances. All Vultr VMs are KVM-based. High Frequency plans use faster 3+ GHz CPUs (often Skylake or AMD) and NVMe storage for better single-thread performance ([High Frequency Compute - 3+ GHz cloud compute with NVMe storage](https://www.vultr.com/products/high-frequency-compute/#:~:text=High%20Frequency%20Compute%20,core%20performance)) – great for game servers.
- **Specs:** Standard plans from **1 vCPU / 1 GB RAM / 25 GB SSD** up to **16 vCPU / 64 GB RAM / 1000 GB SSD** ([Vultr Pricing: VPS, Block Storage, Backup and Bandwidth | 1 Dollar VPS](https://onedollarvps.com/pricing/vultr-pricing#:~:text=Plan%20RAM%20CPU%20Storage%20Bandwidth,64GB%2016%201000GB%20SSD%2050TB%24320%2Fmonth)). High Frequency plans start at **1 vCPU / 1 GB RAM / 25 GB NVMe** and scale to 32 vCPU / 128 GB / 1.6 TB NVMe ([Vultr Pricing: VPS, Block Storage, Backup and Bandwidth | 1 Dollar VPS](https://onedollarvps.com/pricing/vultr-pricing#:~:text=High%20Frequency%20VPS)) ([Vultr Pricing: VPS, Block Storage, Backup and Bandwidth | 1 Dollar VPS](https://onedollarvps.com/pricing/vultr-pricing#:~:text=8GB%208GB%204%20160GB%20NVMe,32%201600GB%20NVMe%20SSD%2050TB%24640%2Fmonth)). Vultr also offers separate high-performance variants (with newer AMD EPYC or Intel Xeon) and bare metal servers.
- **Bandwidth:** Tiered by plan – e.g. 1 TB on the 1 GB instance, up to 6–10 TB on larger plans ([Vultr Pricing: VPS, Block Storage, Backup and Bandwidth | 1 Dollar VPS](https://onedollarvps.com/pricing/vultr-pricing#:~:text=Plan%20RAM%20CPU%20Storage%20Bandwidth,64GB%2016%201000GB%20SSD%2050TB%24320%2Fmonth)) ([Vultr Pricing: VPS, Block Storage, Backup and Bandwidth | 1 Dollar VPS](https://onedollarvps.com/pricing/vultr-pricing#:~:text=High%20Frequency%20VPS)). Some high-tier plans include 15–50 TB. Vultr allows **unmetered** inbound traffic and charges for outbound if you exceed the included TB (overage ~$0.01/GB).
- **Regions:** Very broad geographic coverage. Vultr has ~20 locations including multiple US cities (NY, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Seattle, etc.), Europe (London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Paris), Asia (Tokyo, Seoul, Singapore), Australia (Sydney), and more ([Vultr Pricing: VPS, Block Storage, Backup and Bandwidth | 1 Dollar VPS](https://onedollarvps.com/pricing/vultr-pricing#:~:text=Location%20Price%20per%20GB%20North,Dallas%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20Miami%2C%20Seattle)) ([Vultr Pricing: VPS, Block Storage, Backup and Bandwidth | 1 Dollar VPS](https://onedollarvps.com/pricing/vultr-pricing#:~:text=However%2C%20Vultr%20has%20more%20data,users)). This is useful to host game servers close to your player base.
- **Pricing:** On-demand pricing with hourly billing. **Standard** VMs start at **\$5/month** for 1 GB ([Vultr Pricing: VPS, Block Storage, Backup and Bandwidth | 1 Dollar VPS](https://onedollarvps.com/pricing/vultr-pricing#:~:text=Plan%20RAM%20CPU%20Storage%20Bandwidth,64GB%2016%201000GB%20SSD%2050TB%24320%2Fmonth)) (there’s also a $2.50/mo plan for 512 MB with IPv6-only) ([Vultr Pricing: VPS, Block Storage, Backup and Bandwidth | 1 Dollar VPS](https://onedollarvps.com/pricing/vultr-pricing#:~:text=Standard%20VPS)). **High Frequency** VMs start at **\$6/month** for 1 GB NVMe ([Vultr Pricing: VPS, Block Storage, Backup and Bandwidth | 1 Dollar VPS](https://onedollarvps.com/pricing/vultr-pricing#:~:text=High%20Frequency%20VPS)). For example, 2 vCPU / 2 GB HF is \$12, 4 GB is \$24, etc. ([Vultr Pricing: VPS, Block Storage, Backup and Bandwidth | 1 Dollar VPS](https://onedollarvps.com/pricing/vultr-pricing#:~:text=Plan%20RAM%20CPU%20Storage%20Bandwidth,16%201280GB%20NVMe%20SSD%2010TB%24384%2Fmonth)). Vultr’s **bare metal** servers start around \$120/month for a single-tenant machine (prices vary by specs). *(Tip: Vultr frequently offers promo credits for new users.)*

### Hetzner (Cloud and Dedicated in EU/US)
- **Services:** Hetzner offers both **Cloud VPS** and **Bare-Metal Dedicated** servers. Their cloud instances run on KVM/QEMU on high-end hardware ([I know Contabo uses Proxmox. What does Hetzner and netcup use?](https://www.reddit.com/r/VPS/comments/1ghz4fd/i_know_contabo_uses_proxmox_what_does_hetzner_and/#:~:text=I%20know%20Contabo%20uses%20Proxmox,mix%20of%20CEPH%20and)), and are known for excellent price-to-performance. Dedicated servers (in Hetzner’s auctions or regular lineup) provide full physical hardware at low prices (especially in Europe).
- **Cloud Specs:** “CX” series (Intel CPUs) and “CPX” series (AMD EPYC CPUs). For example, a **CX11** instance has **1 vCPU / 2 GB RAM / 20 GB SSD** for about €3.79/mo (≈\$4) ([hetzner introduces new shared vcpu cloud servers](https://www.hetzner.com/press-release/new-cx-plans/#:~:text=hetzner%20introduces%20new%20shared%20vcpu,79%20a%20month)) ([Hetzner Review - VPSBenchmarks](https://www.vpsbenchmarks.com/hosters/hetzner#:~:text=Cloud%20Server%20Plans%20%3B%20CX11%2C,90%20%2F%20month)). Larger plans: CX12 (2 vCPU/4 GB), CX13 (2 vCPU/8 GB), etc., up to 16 vCPU / 32 GB. AMD-based CPX series offers higher clock speeds; e.g. CPX11 (2 vCPU/2 GB) ~€4.49. All include **20 TB** of traffic on Gigabit (beyond that, speed may be reduced) ([Hetzner new prices and limits for Cloud servers in USA](https://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=1930875#:~:text=Hetzner%20new%20prices%20and%20limits,99%2020%20TB%202%20TB)).
- **Dedicated Specs:** A wide range. Affordable options include older generation CPUs on auction (e.g. **Intel i7-6700** or **AMD Ryzen 5 3600** with 32 GB RAM and SSDs for ~€30–€50). Current-gen options like **AMD EPYC** or **Intel Xeon** CPUs with 128+ GB RAM are available in the €80–€150 range. For instance, Hetzner’s AX line offers **AMD Ryzen 3900** (12-core) with 64 GB RAM and 2×512 NVMe for around €64/mo. All dedicated servers have **unmetered inbound & 20 TB outbound** (then throttled to 10 Mbit) on 1 Gbit/s ports.
- **Data Centers:** Europe (Germany and Finland) and recently the USA. Hetzner’s main locations are Falkenstein and Nuremberg (Germany), Helsinki (Finland), and a U.S. East coast location in Ashburn, VA. (Their cloud plans can be deployed in these regions; dedicated servers are EU-based or soon expanding).
- **Pricing:** Hetzner Cloud is extremely cheap: the **CX11** at ~€3.79/mo is ~\$4.00 ([Hetzner Review - VPSBenchmarks](https://www.vpsbenchmarks.com/hosters/hetzner#:~:text=Cloud%20Server%20Plans%20%3B%20CX11%2C,90%20%2F%20month)), and even a 8 vCPU / 16 GB VM is under \$30. Dedicated servers: e.g. an **AMD Ryzen 5 3600X (6c/12t, 64 GB RAM)** in the “Gaming” lineup was about \$91/month in 2023 ([Where to buy a dedicated ryzen 5 server? : r/webhosting - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/webhosting/comments/lucjn6/where_to_buy_a_dedicated_ryzen_5_server/#:~:text=Reddit%20www,on%20them%20is%20a)) ([Giving away two OVH Ryzen Game Dedicated Servers : r/OVHcloud](https://www.reddit.com/r/OVHcloud/comments/12vwit4/giving_away_two_ovh_ryzen_game_dedicated_servers/#:~:text=r%2FOVHcloud%20www,most)). Auction servers can be much lower. *Note:* Hetzner bills in EUR (non-EU customers exclude VAT). They are a top choice if your user base is okay with EU/US East latency.

### OVHcloud (VPS and Dedicated)
- **Services:** OVHcloud provides budget-friendly **VPS instances** as well as a wide range of **Dedicated Servers**. OVH uses KVM for VPS virtualization (confirmed to work with Docker) ([What applications can't be run on LXC VPS? What are its limitations?](https://lowendspirit.com/discussion/5847/what-applications-cant-be-run-on-lxc-vps-what-are-its-limitations#:~:text=What%20applications%20can%27t%20be%20run,lxc%2F%20%3B%20and%20other)). They also specialize in **“Game” dedicated servers** optimized for game hosting (high clock speeds + robust DDoS protection).
- **VPS Specs:** Multiple tiers – *Value*, *Essential*, *Comfort* – each with options. For example, **VPS Value** offers 1 vCore with 2 GB RAM (expandable to 4 GB) and 20–40 GB SSD. **VPS Essential** offers 2 vCores with 4–8 GB RAM, and **Comfort** up to 4 vCores 16 GB. All come with SSD storage and unlimited traffic with a generous fair use cap (typically **250 Mbps unmetered**, or a high TB quota) on OVH’s global network.
- **VPS Pricing:** Very affordable, often with promo discounts. As of early 2025, a **Value 2 GB VPS** is around **$5–6/mo** (OVH lists \$7 -> \$5.95 on sale) ([VPS KVM: powerful hosting server | OVHcloud Worldwide](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/vps/vps-kvm/#:~:text=Run%20multiple%20VMs%20with%20confidence,98)). Essential 4 GB around \$10, Comfort 8 GB around \$16 ([VPS KVM: powerful hosting server | OVHcloud Worldwide](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/vps/vps-kvm/#:~:text=Run%20multiple%20VMs%20with%20confidence,98)). These prices can fluctuate with exchange rates and promotions. OVH’s Public Cloud (hourly billing instances similar to AWS) are pricier, so the fixed VPS plans are usually a better deal for Pterodactyl.
- **Dedicated Specs:** OVH has several lines – **Rise** (cost-effective), **Advance** (balanced), **Game** (gaming optimized), and **High-End**. For example, a **Game-1** server comes with **AMD EPYC 7343P (8-core @ 3.8/5.3GHz)**, 32 GB RAM, 2×960 GB NVMe, starting around **$171/month** ([Game Dedicated Servers](https://us.ovhcloud.com/bare-metal/game/#:~:text=Game)). More affordable options: OVH’s subsidiary SoYouStart offers older gen **Intel i7/Ryzen servers ~\$50–\$80**. All OVH dedicated servers include **IPMI/KVM**, a **500 Mbps–1 Gbps port**, and **unmetered bandwidth** (with strong **anti-DDoS** included, critical for game servers ([Game Dedicated Servers](https://us.ovhcloud.com/bare-metal/game/#:~:text=Anti)) ([Game Dedicated Servers](https://us.ovhcloud.com/bare-metal/game/#:~:text=Game%20DDoS%20Protection))).
- **Data Centers:** OVH is based in Europe (France, UK, Germany) and Canada, with some presence in the US and Asia. Their network is extensive: e.g. gravely low ping in EU (Gravelines, Strasbourg, etc.) and BHS in Montreal for NA. Check OVH region availability when ordering (some VPS tiers are region-specific).
- **Pricing:** **VPS:** starts ~$5 and up as noted. **Dedicated:** the “GAME” series ranges \$100–\$200+ for newest hardware, but older **Ryzen 5 3600X** servers were ~$91/mo ([Where to buy a dedicated ryzen 5 server? : r/webhosting - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/webhosting/comments/lucjn6/where_to_buy_a_dedicated_ryzen_5_server/#:~:text=Reddit%20www,on%20them%20is%20a)) ([Giving away two OVH Ryzen Game Dedicated Servers : r/OVHcloud](https://www.reddit.com/r/OVHcloud/comments/12vwit4/giving_away_two_ovh_ryzen_game_dedicated_servers/#:~:text=r%2FOVHcloud%20www,most)) and SoYouStart offers mid-range dedicated for \$40–\$70. OVH often charges setup fees for month-to-month, which they waive during promotions. Overall, OVH is popular for game hosting due to the included DDoS mitigation and network quality.

### AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- **Services:** AWS provides immense flexibility with **EC2 cloud instances** in various families (General Purpose, Compute Optimized, etc.), as well as related services. It uses a custom Xen-based/KVM hypervisor (supports Docker). While AWS doesn’t have traditional “VPS plans,” their **Lightsail** service offers fixed-price VM bundles similar to other VPS providers, and AWS also offers **bare-metal instances** for specialized needs.
- **Specs:** **EC2 Instances:** Too many types to list 😅 – common types include t3/t4 (burstable CPUs), m5/m6 (general), c5/c6 (compute optimized), etc. For example, a **t3.small** has **2 vCPU (burstable) / 2 GB RAM* ([t3.small pricing and specs - Vantage](https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/t3.small#:~:text=The%20t3,0208%20per%20hour))】. You choose and attach storage (EBS volumes) separately. **Lightsail Instances:** simpler tiers, e.g. 1 GB RAM / 1 vCPU / 40 GB SSD.
- **Performance:** AWS instances deliver reliable performance, especially the dedicated core types. For game servers, you’d likely use a general-purpose or compute-optimized instance for steady CPU. Burstable types (t3/t4) can work for low-medium loads but might throttle if CPU credits run out during peak usage.
- **Regions:** AWS has the **broadest global coverage** – multiple regions across North America, South America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and more (over 20 regions). You can host your node close to players (e.g. us-east-1 in Virginia, eu-west-3 in Paris, ap-southeast-2 in Sydney, etc.).
- **Pricing:** **On-Demand EC2** pricing is pay-as-you-go and can be higher than fixed VPS plans. For example, a **t3.small** costs about **$0.0208/hour** (≈\$15/month) in US Eas ([t3.small pricing and specs - Vantage](https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/t3.small#:~:text=The%20t3,0208%20per%20hour))】. Note this **does not include bandwidth** – AWS charges ~$0.09 per GB after a small free outbound allowance. You can reduce costs with 1-year or 3-year Reserved Instances or use Spot instances (not ideal for persistent game servers due to interruption). **Lightsail Pricing:** more predictable – e.g. **$5/mo** for 1 GB/1vCPU/40GB with **2 TB** included transfe ([VPS, web hosting pricing—Amazon Lightsail—Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/pricing/#:~:text=1%20TB%20Transfer))】, or \$3.50 for 512 MB/20GB with 1 TB transfe ([VPS, web hosting pricing—Amazon Lightsail—Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/pricing/#:~:text=%243))】. Lightsail is essentially a packaged EC2 with free bandwidth up to a limit (beyond which it’s \$0.05/G ([DigitalOcean vs AWS Lightsail: Which Cloud Platform is Right for You?](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/digitalocean-vs-awslightsail#:~:text=You%3F%20www,to%2010TB%20per%20month))】). New AWS users get **12 months Free Tier** (750 hours/month of a t2.micro or t3.micro, which is ~1 GB RAM) plus \$100+ in credit ([Free Trial and Free Tier Services and Products - Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/free#:~:text=Cloud%20cloud,activate%20your%20full%20paid%20account))】.

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Services:** Google Compute Engine (GCE) VMs, similar to AWS EC2. GCP uses KVM-based virtualization. It also has an easier **Google Cloud Run/Kubernetes** for containerized apps, but for Pterodactyl you’ll use normal VM instances. GCP offers an **Always Free tier** for a small instance and a generous \$300 free credit for new account ([Free Trial and Free Tier Services and Products - Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/free#:~:text=Free%20Trial%20and%20Free%20Tier,activate%20your%20full%20paid%20account))】.
- **Specs:** GCP’s machine types: E2 (cost-effective shared-core), N2/N2D (balanced), C2 (compute-optimized), etc. Notably, the **e2-micro instance (2 vCPU burst share, 1 GB RAM)** is free within certain usage limits. A step up, **e2-small (2 vCPU, 2 GB)** costs around \$6–\$7 per month on sustained us ([Google Cloud Pricing: How Much Will It Cost You in 2025?](https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/google-cloud-pricing/#:~:text=2025%3F%20www,N2)) ([Google Cloud Pricing: How Much Will It Cost You in 2025?](https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/google-cloud-pricing/#:~:text=Short%20on%20Time%3F%20These%20Are,Cloud%E2%80%99s%20Best%20Plans%20in%202025))】. Larger VMs can be configured with custom CPU/RAM counts.
- **Performance:** GCP VMs are high quality; C2 instances boast very fast CPUs (good for game tick rate). Networking is excellent on Google’s backbone. Disk performance is also strong (Persistent SSDs or local SSD options for higher IOPS).
- **Regions:** Global coverage comparable to AWS – e.g. **us-central1 (Iowa)**, **europe-west1 (Belgium)**, **asia-southeast1 (Singapore)**, etc. Many regions and zones to choose from, which is great for minimizing latency.
- **Pricing:** GCP has a complex but potentially lower cost structure if you use sustained-use discounts. For instance, an **e2-micro** is free for ~720 hours/month in select regions; beyond that, it’s ~$0.0068/hour. The **e2-small (2GB)** is about **$0.0083/hour** (~\$6.11/month) on sustained us ([Google Cloud Pricing: How Much Will It Cost You in 2025?](https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/google-cloud-pricing/#:~:text=Short%20on%20Time%3F%20These%20Are,Cloud%E2%80%99s%20Best%20Plans%20in%202025))】. GCP charges outgoing bandwidth similarly to AWS (~\$0.12/GB from most regions, with small free quotas). Committed-use discounts for 1yr/3yr can save ~20-30%. In short, on-demand GCP is competitive with AWS/Azure (e.g. 2vCPU/4GB ~\$25-30/mo ([Google Cloud Pricing: How Much Will It Cost You in 2025?](https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/google-cloud-pricing/#:~:text=Short%20on%20Time%3F%20These%20Are,Cloud%E2%80%99s%20Best%20Plans%20in%202025))】, but careful use of the free tier and discounts can make it affordable.

### Microsoft Azure 
- **Services:** Azure offers a range of VM sizes on its cloud platform, using Hyper-V based virtualization. It’s enterprise-oriented but also provides a **12-month free trial** with credits and some free instance usage (750 hours of a B1s VM on Linux ([Windows Virtual Machines Pricing - Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/windows/#:~:text=Get%20750%20hours%20each%20of,every%20month%20for%2012%20months))】.
- **Specs:** Common Azure VM series for small deployments include **B-series (burstable)** and D-series (general). For example, **Standard B1s** is **1 vCPU / 1 GB RAM**, suitable for a small panel or test node. Larger sizes go up incrementally (B2s: 2 vCPU/4 GB, etc.).
- **Performance:** B-series can burst CPU when needed but have credits like AWS T-series. For consistently busy game servers, you might prefer Dv2/Dv3 (dedicated performance) or F-series (compute focused).
- **Regions:** Azure has dozens of regions worldwide (often more than AWS/GCP in certain areas). You can deploy in Americas, Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, etc. – ensure to choose a region that supports the VM size you need.
- **Pricing:** Azure on-demand pricing is similar to AWS. A **B1s** instance is about **$0.0104/hour** (East US) for Linu ([Standard-B1s Pricing and Specs: Azure VM](https://costcalc.cloudoptimo.com/azure-pricing-calculator/vm/Standard-B1s#:~:text=Standard,Price%20%2F%20HourEast%20US))】 – roughly \$7.50/month. Azure’s pricing page notes 750 hours of B1s are free for the first yea ([Windows Virtual Machines Pricing - Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/windows/#:~:text=Get%20750%20hours%20each%20of,every%20month%20for%2012%20months))】. Outbound bandwidth costs about \$0.087/GB after the first 5 GB. Like others, discounts are available for 1-3 year reserved terms or spot VMs. Educational or Visual Studio subscribers might have free credits. In general, unless you have credits, Azure can be on the higher side for always-on game servers compared to fixed-price VPS providers.

### Contabo (High-Spec Budget VPS and Dedicated)
- **Services:** Contabo is known for **budget VMs with large resources** and some dedicated server offerings. They use KVM virtualization with their own management (often leveraging Proxmox ([Chronicles of the Pioneers – Keeper of the Cloud | Contabo Blog](https://contabo.com/blog/chronicles-of-the-pioneers-keeper-of-the-cloud/#:~:text=Chronicles%20of%20the%20Pioneers%20%E2%80%93,valuable%20insights%20into%20system%20management)) ([Don't get a Contabo server - Ferdinand Mütsch](https://muetsch.io/don-t-get-a-contabo-server.html#:~:text=Plus%2C%20they%20run%20their%20virtual,level%20virtualization%20%28e.g.))】. Contabo’s VPS plans stand out for offering high vCPU counts, large RAM, and huge disk sizes at low prices – perfect for hosting many game servers, though it’s a shared environment.
- **Specs:** For example, Contabo’s **Cloud VPS S** plan (~\$6/month) includes **4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 200 GB SSD** and **32 TB** outbound traffi ([Contabo VPS Review (Aug 2024): High Quality at Low Prices](https://hostadvice.com/hosting-company/contabo-reviews/contabo-vps-hosting-review/#:~:text=The%20cheapest%20plan%20starts%20at,The%20most))】. Even the cheapest tier (~\$5.50/mo on annual term) gives 4 vCPU, 6 GB RAM, 100 GB NVM ([Contabo VPS Review (Aug 2024): High Quality at Low Prices](https://hostadvice.com/hosting-company/contabo-reviews/contabo-vps-hosting-review/#:~:text=The%20cheapest%20plan%20starts%20at,The%20most))】. Higher tiers scale to 10 vCPU / 30 GB / 800 GB, etc. They also offer “Storage VPS” with larger HDD storage. **Dedicated cores** (Virtual Dedicated instances) are available at higher price points for guaranteed performance.
- **Bandwidth:** **32 TB of outgoing traffic** is included on all VPS plan ([Reliable VPS Hosting in Singapore | High-Performance & Affordable](https://contabo.com/en-us/vps-singapore/#:~:text=Affordable%20contabo,32%20TB%20outbound%20and)) ([Storage VPS with High Volume and Fast SSD - Contabo](https://contabo.com/en-us/storage-vps/#:~:text=Storage%20VPS%20with%20High%20Volume,and%20unlimited%20inbound%20data))】 (incoming is unmetered). This is effectively almost-unlimited for most use cases – if you exceed 32 TB, they throttle to 10 Mbps for the rest of the month. Network port is 1 Gbps. Contabo’s global routing is decent (they’ve expanded out of Germany to worldwide locations now).
- **Data Centers:** Contabo operates **12 data centers worldwide** (as of 2025 ([Powerful Dedicated Servers Hosting at an Unbeatable Price | Contabo](https://contabo.com/en-us/dedicated-servers/#:~:text=Powerful%20Dedicated%20Servers%20Hosting%20at,CPU%20AMD%20EPYC))】. Regions include Germany (Nuremberg, Munich), UK, USA East (New York) & West (Seattle), and Asia (Singapore ([Powerful Dedicated Servers Hosting at an Unbeatable Price | Contabo](https://contabo.com/en-us/dedicated-servers/#:~:text=Powerful%20Dedicated%20Servers%20Hosting%20at,CPU%20AMD%20EPYC))】. This is great for global coverage on a budget, though latency/routing may not be as optimized as premium clouds.
- **Pricing:** Contabo is arguably the **best price-to-spec** provider. Plans start at ~$5–\$7 per month for a VM with specs that would cost 2-3x on other ([Contabo VPS Review (Aug 2024): High Quality at Low Prices](https://hostadvice.com/hosting-company/contabo-reviews/contabo-vps-hosting-review/#:~:text=The%20cheapest%20plan%20starts%20at,The%20most))】. For example, 4 vCPU / 8 GB RAM for \$6 is unbeatabl ([Contabo VPS Review (Aug 2024): High Quality at Low Prices](https://hostadvice.com/hosting-company/contabo-reviews/contabo-vps-hosting-review/#:~:text=The%20cheapest%20plan%20starts%20at,The%20most))】. However, note that Contabo’s vCPUs are shared – performance per core may be lower, and you might not get full use of all 4 cores at 100% 24/7. Dedicated servers from Contabo (e.g. a Ryzen 9 5900X with 64 GB) are also competitively priced (around \$120/mo). Keep in mind Contabo may charge setup fees and does not offer hourly billing – it’s month-to-month or longer. Despite slightly lower single-core performance, many Pterodactyl users run Contabo for the sheer amount of RAM/storage per dollar.

**In summary**, choose a provider that fits your budget and performance needs. Ensure it uses **KVM or bare metal** so Docker runs smoothl ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=When%20your%20provider%20uses%20,KVM%20is%20guaranteed%20to%20work))】. If you host a small community server, a \$5–\$10 VPS from DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, etc. will suffice. For larger deployments or heavy game servers (e.g. Minecraft with many players), consider dedicated servers from OVH/Hetzner or high-tier VMs. Also factor in data center location (to minimize player latency) and bandwidth costs (providers like OVH and Contabo include very high traffic, whereas AWS/GCP charge extra). The above options are all confirmed to work with Pterodactyl Wings (Docker) – if in doubt, ask the host about Docker support or run `systemd-detect-virt` on the server (it should **not** return “OpenVZ” or “LXC” ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=When%20your%20provider%20uses%20,KVM%20is%20guaranteed%20to%20work))】.

## 2. Domain and Subdomain Setup for Pterodactyl (“Domaining”)

Using a custom domain for your Pterodactyl panel and nodes is highly recommended. It allows you to access the panel at a friendly URL (e.g. **panel.example.com**) and your Wings daemons at identifiable subdomains (e.g. **node1.example.com**, **node2.example.com**). This section covers how to configure DNS records for those domains and how to handle them with proxies or web servers for SSL and WebSocket support.

### DNS Basics and Choosing Your Domain Setup
Pterodactyl requires at least **two domain names** (or subdomains) if you are running the panel and node on separate hostnames: one for the Panel and one for the Wings daemo ([Pterodactyl Panel Installation Help : r/admincraft](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/zhmbvy/pterodactyl_panel_installation_help/#:~:text=Impossible))】. For example, you might use `panel.mygames.com` for the web interface and `node1.mygames.com` for the node. If you have multiple Wings nodes, you’d assign each a unique subdomain (node2, node3, etc.). In cases where the panel and node are on the **same server**, you *still* typically use separate DNS names – the panel runs on port 80/443, and the Wings daemon on a different port (8080 or 8443), each secured with their own certificate.

**Steps to set up DNS:**
1. **Decide on Domain/Subdomains:** If you own `example.com`, you can create subdomains like `panel.example.com` and `node1.example.com`. Alternatively, you could buy a new domain just for your game panel. Ensure you have control of the DNS settings for the domain (through your registrar or DNS host).
2. **Create DNS **A** Records:** In your DNS provider’s management interface, create an **A record** for each hostname pointing to the server’s IP address. For instance:
   - **Name:** `panel` (or `panel.example.com` depending on interface) – **Type:** A – **Value:** `YOUR.SERVER.IPv4` (e.g. 203.0.113.45).
   - **Name:** `node1` – **Type:** A – **Value:** (same server IP if panel and node on one machine, or the node’s IP if separate).
   If your servers have IPv6, also add corresponding **AAAA records** with the IPv6 address. There is usually no need for a CNAME here unless you want `www.panel.example.com` aliasing to `panel.example.com` or similar edge cases.
3. **Propagation:** After saving DNS changes, give it some time (a few minutes up to 24 hours) to propagate. You can verify by pinging the subdomain (ping panel.example.com) or using `nslookup`/`dig` to see if it resolves to the correct IP.

Your DNS provider’s UI may look different, but the concept is the same. For example, on Cloudflare DNS, you’d go to the DNS tab and click “Add Record”, choose A, enter “panel” for name and the IP, and similarly for “node1”. On GoDaddy or Namecheap, you’ll find a section to add host records. If using a service like Google Domains or Route53, it’s also straightforward to add A/AAAA records. Here’s a summary of what you want:

- **panel.example.com -> A -> 123.45.67.89** (IPv4 of panel server)  
- **panel.example.com -> AAAA -> 2600:1234:...** (IPv6 of panel server, if applicable)  
- **node1.example.com -> A -> 123.45.67.89** (IPv4 of node server; use a different IP if panel and node are on separate machines)  
- **node1.example.com -> AAAA -> [IPv6]** (if applicable)

*(Replace with your actual domain and IPs. If you don’t have IPv6 on the server, you can omit AAAA records.)*

### Configuring the Panel’s Domain with a Web Server
Once DNS is pointing the domain to your server, you need to configure a web server to serve the Pterodactyl Panel on that domain. The panel software (a PHP/Laravel app) typically runs behind a webserver like **Nginx** or Apache, which handles HTTP requests for the domain. We will assume Nginx (as per the official installation guide). The goals are to: **serve the panel on port 80/443**, and **redirect HTTP to HTTPS** for security.

**Nginx setup for panel.example.com:**
1. Install Nginx on the panel server (if not already). Remove any default site that might conflict: e.g. `sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default ([Webserver Configuration | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/webserver_configuration.html#:~:text=First%2C%20remove%20the%20default%20NGINX,configuration))】.
2. Create an Nginx configuration for the panel. For example, `/etc/nginx/sites-available/pterodactyl.conf` with the following (taken from Pterodactyl’s docs):

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name panel.example.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name panel.example.com;

    root /var/www/pterodactyl/public;
    index index.php;

    # Log files for debugging
    access_log /var/log/nginx/pterodactyl.app-access.log;
    error_log  /var/log/nginx/pterodactyl.app-error.log error;

    # Allow large uploads and long script runtimes
    client_max_body_size 100m;
    client_body_timeout 120s;

    sendfile off;

    # SSL certificates
    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/panel.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/panel.example.com/privkey.pem;

    # (Other SSL options and location ~ \.php$ blocks, etc., as per docs)
}
```  

This configuration **forces all HTTP requests to HTTPS** (the first server block sends a 301 redirect from port 80 to 443 ([Webserver Configuration | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/webserver_configuration.html#:~:text=server%20%7B%20,return%20301%20https%3A%2F%2F%24server_name%24request_uri%3B))】. The second block listens on **443** with SSL and serves the Pterodactyl panel directory. Make sure to replace `panel.example.com` with your actual domain in the config and adjust paths if your setup differs. The `ssl_certificate` lines should point to your Let’s Encrypt cert files – we’ll obtain those in the next section. If you follow the standard Let’s Encrypt setup, the paths as shown (`/etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>/fullchain.pem`) are correc ([Webserver Configuration | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/webserver_configuration.html#:~:text=sendfile%20off%3B))】.

3. Enable the site and restart Nginx:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/pterodactyl.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/pterodactyl.conf
   sudo nginx -t  # test config
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```
   At this point, Nginx is ready to serve the panel. If you visit `http://panel.example.com` it should redirect to HTTPS (which won’t work until we install the SSL certificate). You can temporarily change `listen 443 ssl` to `listen 443` and comment out the `return 301` line to test via HTTP first, but it’s best to set up SSL right away as shown.

**Reverse Proxy / Alternative Webserver:** If you already have a webserver or are using a reverse proxy (like Traefik, Caddy, or Nginx Proxy Manager) to manage multiple services, you can integrate the panel domain there. The key is to proxy `panel.example.com` traffic to the Pterodactyl panel’s internal port (if running PHP-FPM or an internal server). Many users simply stick with Nginx as above, since the panel is a web app and Nginx is straightforward for PHP apps.

### Configuring Subdomain for Wings (Node)
Each Wings daemon also benefits from having a DNS name (node1.example.com). The Wings software itself listens on a port (default **8080** for HTTP; or you can run it behind SSL on 8443 as we’ll see). Unlike the panel, Wings is not served by Nginx (it’s a Go binary that serves its own API/websocket). However, you **still use DNS** so that the panel and users connect to `node1.example.com` instead of an IP. 

For the basic setup, simply ensure you created the **A record** for `node1.example.com` pointing to the node’s IP as described earlier. In the Pterodactyl Panel’s admin UI, when you create the node, you will specify an “FQDN” for the node – use `node1.example.com` there. If the panel is using HTTPS, you must also configure Wings to use HTTPS on that FQDN (so that the panel-websocket connection is secure) – more on that in the SSL section. The official docs note: *“When your Panel is using SSL, the Wings must also have one for its FQDN.” ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=WARNING))】 If you skip this, you’ll encounter issues where the panel cannot connect to the daemon (for example, file manager or console showing errors) because of mixed content or invalid cert ([The list of files is not displayed with specific SSL settings · Issue #1403 · pterodactyl/panel · GitHub](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/issues/1403#:~:text=parkervcp%20%20%20commented%20,67))】.

By default, Wings listens on port 8080 for HTTP. If you keep it that way, the panel will try to connect to `http://node1.example.com:8080` (or `wss://` for websockets). This is problematic if the panel site is HTTPS – browsers will block the mixed content (an HTTPS page making WS calls to an unencrypted ws://). **Therefore, you should enable SSL for Wings**, which means running it on **HTTPS (WSS)**. There are two ways:
- **Direct SSL in Wings:** Obtain a certificate for `node1.example.com` and configure Wings to use it (set `ssl.enabled: true` and paths to the `.pem` files in the Wings config).
- **Reverse Proxy for Wings:** Run Nginx (or Caddy, etc.) in front of Wings to terminate SSL. For example, you could proxy `node1.example.com:443` to `localhost:8080`. This is more complex and generally not needed if Wings can handle SSL itself.

Most use the first method now. We’ll cover obtaining SSL for Wings in the next section. If you do use a proxy, ensure it supports WebSocket forwarding (in Nginx, you’d need `proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";` for the WS connections). Also, if using Cloudflare proxy (orange cloud) in front of Wings, note that **Cloudflare does not proxy arbitrary ports** – you’d have to move Wings to a Cloudflare-supported port (e.g. 8443 ([Additional Configuration | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/configuration.html#:~:text=To%20enable%20Cloudflare%20proxy%2C%20you,orange%20cloud%20enabled%20beside%20it))】. We’ll touch on Cloudflare specifically below.

### Using Cloudflare or Other Reverse Proxies
**Cloudflare** is commonly used for domains to provide DNS and CDN/proxy services. You can use Cloudflare DNS simply for the names (with the proxy “off” - gray cloud), or enable their proxy (orange cloud) to hide your server IP and potentially mitigate DDoS. For Pterodactyl:
- It’s fine to proxy the **Panel** through Cloudflare. Cloudflare supports WebSockets and will allow the panel’s traffic (just make sure to use “Full (strict)” SSL mode and not “Flexible”). The panel runs on standard ports 80/443 which Cloudflare proxies with no issue. If proxied, the panel’s visitors actually connect to Cloudflare’s IP, and Cloudflare forwards to your server.
- Proxying the **Wings daemon** is more tricky and generally **not beneficial* ([Additional Configuration | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/configuration.html#:~:text=))】. When players connect to game servers, they do so directly (Cloudflare doesn’t proxy that traffic unless you have Spectrum on Enterprise). The panel-to-daemon communication can be proxied, but as noted, Cloudflare only proxies certain ports. By default Wings on 8080 with SSL won’t work because Cloudflare’s free proxy allows 8080 *only for HTTP, not HTTPS ([Additional Configuration | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/configuration.html#:~:text=To%20enable%20Cloudflare%20proxy%2C%20you,orange%20cloud%20enabled%20beside%20it))】. The official advice: if you *must* proxy the node, change Wings to listen on port **8443** (one of Cloudflare’s supported HTTPS ports) and update the panel node config accordingl ([Additional Configuration | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/configuration.html#:~:text=To%20enable%20Cloudflare%20proxy%2C%20you,orange%20cloud%20enabled%20beside%20it))】. Even then, the benefit is limited (node’s IP will still be revealed when players join game servers, and SFTP can’t be proxied).
  
In summary, a common approach is: **Cloudflare proxy enabled (orange cloud) for the panel’s DNS record**, and **proxy disabled (gray cloud) for node DNS records**. This way, `panel.example.com` is protected and uses Cloudflare’s SSL, while `node1.example.com` connections go directly to your machine. Remember to set the panel config `APP_BEHIND_PROXY=true` if using Cloudflare, so Pterodactyl trusts Cloudflare’s X-Forwarded-For headers to get real IPs.

**Nginx/Proxy Manager:** If you use Nginx Proxy Manager or another reverse proxy tool to manage multiple services (say you have other sites on the same server), you can host Pterodactyl panel behind it at `panel.example.com`. Ensure you configure WebSocket support (for the panel’s socket connections to work). Typically, this means enabling the proxying of `Socket.IO` or `WS` in your proxy config for the panel domain. Pterodactyl’s docs provide an example for Nginx with the necessary settings, so use that as a referenc ([The list of files is not displayed with specific SSL settings · Issue #1403 · pterodactyl/panel · GitHub](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/issues/1403#:~:text=edited))】.

**Troubleshooting domain issues:**
- If `panel.example.com` isn’t reachable, check DNS propagation (use an external DNS lookup tool to verify it resolves to your IP). Also ensure any cloud firewall (like EC2 security group) or server firewall (ufw/iptables) allows ports 80 and 443.
- If the panel loads but shows “Whoops, looks like something went wrong” after domain change, make sure the **APP_URL** in Pterodactyl’s `.env` is set to `https://panel.example.com` and you ran `php artisan config:cache` if needed.
- If the Wings node in the panel shows a red heart icon and can’t connect, it’s likely a DNS or SSL issue: verify `node1.example.com` resolves and that Wings is running with SSL on that host. You can also check the Wings logs for errors binding to the IP/port.

## 3. Let’s Encrypt SSL and HTTPS Setup

Enabling HTTPS is crucial for secure management and to avoid issues with WebSockets and logins. We will obtain **Let’s Encrypt SSL certificates** for both the panel and the wings node domains. Let’s Encrypt provides free, trusted SSL certs. We’ll use **Certbot** (the official ACME client) for automation. The process involves installing certbot, obtaining certificates, configuring them in Nginx (for the panel) or in Wings, and setting up auto-renewal.

### Installing Certbot (ACME Client)
On Ubuntu or Debian, you can install Certbot from apt. Since our panel is served by Nginx, we’ll also install the Nginx plugin for Certbot to allow automatic webserver configuration:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
``` 
*(On CentOS/Alma, use `dnf install certbot python3-certbot-nginx`, or see certbot.eff.org for instructions for your OS ([Creating SSL Certificates | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/tutorials/creating_ssl_certificates.html#:~:text=To%20begin%2C%20we%20will%20install,have%20to%20stop%20your%20webserver))】.*

This will install the `certbot` tool. The Nginx plugin helps by automatically editing the Nginx config to include the new cert and perform the HTTP-01 challenge without you needing to stop the serve ([Creating SSL Certificates | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/tutorials/creating_ssl_certificates.html#:~:text=To%20begin%2C%20we%20will%20install,have%20to%20stop%20your%20webserver)) ([Creating SSL Certificates | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/tutorials/creating_ssl_certificates.html#:~:text=Ubuntu%20distributions%2C%20but%20you%20can,have%20to%20stop%20your%20webserver))】. (If you’re using Apache, install `python3-certbot-apache` instead.)

### Obtaining an SSL Certificate for the Panel
Before running Certbot, ensure that:
- Your **panel domain (panel.example.com)** is pointing to this server’s IP (DNS A record in place as above).
- Port **80** is open and reaching Nginx (Certbot needs to serve a validation file via HTTP). If you have Cloudflare proxy on, temporarily disable proxy (so Let’s Encrypt can reach your server directly), or use the DNS challenge method.

To get a certificate for the panel domain using the Nginx plugin, run:
```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d panel.example.com
``` 
Certbot will perform the ACME challenge (placing a token in `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` and Let’s Encrypt will verify it via HTTP on your domain). If successful, Certbot will obtain the cert and automatically update your Nginx config to include the `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` lines (you may have already added them as shown earlier; certbot will detect and fill the paths). It will also likely ask if you want to redirect HTTP to HTTPS – choose yes (Certbot can add the 301 redirect for you if not already in config). After this, your panel should be accessible at **https://panel.example.com** with a green lock.

If you prefer to do it manually (or are using a different webserver), you can use:
```bash
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d panel.example.com
``` 
This will obtain the cert without auto-configuring a webserver (it runs its own temporary server on port 80). You’d then manually edit the Nginx config to point to the cert files in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/panel.example.com/`. The Certbot Nginx plugin method is simpler for most cases.

💡 *Certbot will place certificates in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>/`. The key file is `privkey.pem` and the full certificate chain is in `fullchain.pem`. Ensure these paths match what your Nginx config expects. The official Pterodactyl config uses that same directory structu ([Webserver Configuration | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/webserver_configuration.html#:~:text=sendfile%20off%3B))2】.*

Once done, visit the panel in a browser via HTTPS. It should load without warnings. If you get an “Insecure content” warning, double-check that you’re not loading the site via IP or that there are no mixed content resources. By default, Pterodactyl should load everything relative to APP_URL which is now HTTPS, so it should be fine.

### Obtaining SSL for Wings (Node)
For the Wings daemon at `node1.example.com`, the process is similar but we might not have a webserver serving that domain. We have two options to get its certificate:
- Use **Certbot in standalone mode** on the node server.
- Use the **DNS challenge** (especially if port 80 on the node is not accessible or you prefer not to run a standalone server).

**Standalone method:** Log into your node server (if it’s the same as panel server, you can do it there too, but often nodes might be separate). Run:
```bash
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d node1.example.com
``` 
This tells Certbot to spin up a temporary server on port 80 to validate the domain. It will ask you for an email and agreement just like before. Ensure nothing else is using port 80 on that node (if your panel and node are same machine, Nginx is on 80, so you might have to stop Nginx briefly or use the `--nginx` plugin there as well by temporarily creating a server block for node1 domain). Alternatively, since Wings doesn’t normally serve HTTP on port 80, you can stop Wings if it was using 8080 (not needed for 80) – not an issue. Once validation succeeds, you’ll get a certificate for node1.

If your node is remote and perhaps behind a firewall that doesn’t allow port 80, you can use the **DNS challenge**. This requires adding a TXT record to your DNS. Certbot has a manual or automatic mode for this, or you could use the `acme.sh` client with an API token for your DNS provider. Explaining DNS challenge: you’d run `certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns -d node1.example.com` and it will prompt you to create a TXT record `_acme-challenge.node1` with a certain val ([Creating SSL Certificates | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/tutorials/creating_ssl_certificates.html#:~:text=Then%2C%20in%20the%20command%20below%2C,not%20covered%20in%20this%20tutorial))0】. Once you add that and let it propagate, Let’s Encrypt verifies it and issues the cert. This is more complex but bypasses needing port 80.

**Configure Wings to use SSL:** After obtaining the cert for the node, you need to tell Wings to use it. When you created the node in the panel, you likely downloaded or copy-pasted a config file (`/etc/pterodactyl/config.yml`). In that YAML, there’s an `api` section with host and port. Set:
```yaml
api:
    host: 0.0.0.0
    port: 8080
    ssl:
       enabled: true
       cert: /etc/letsencrypt/live/node1.example.com/fullchain.pem
       key: /etc/letsencrypt/live/node1.example.com/privkey.pem
```
Make sure those paths are correct (that’s where Certbot places them by default). If you installed certbot on the panel machine but your node is separate, you’ll need to either copy the cert files to the node or run certbot on the node itself. It’s usually best to run it on the node so renewal can be automated there as well.

Restart the Wings daemon after editing the config: `sudo systemctl restart wings`. Watch the Wings logs (`journalctl -u wings -f`) – if it starts successfully with “HTTPS enabled” or no errors binding, then it’s serving on 8080 with SSL now. The panel will communicate with it over `https://node1.example.com:8080`. The panel knows to use HTTPS if you marked the node as having SSL in the panel (in Admin -> Nodes -> configuration, the **scheme** changes based on the “Behind Proxy” setting or if you used FQDN with SSL). In Pterodactyl 1.x, by default if your panel is HTTPS and the node has an FQDN, it will try HTTPS for daemon. (Earlier versions had a toggle “Behind Proxy” which influenced it).

Now, visiting the panel, your node should show a green heart (connected). If not, check the **Allowed Ports/Firewall**: ensure port 8080 (or 8443 if you changed) is open inbound on the node. Also ensure the panel can resolve the node’s domain (it should, using system DNS).

### Automating SSL Renewal
Let’s Encrypt certificates expire every 90 days, so automation is important. Certbot, by default, installs a cron job or systemd timer to renew. You can verify by running `sudo certbot renew --dry-run` to test renewal. If you used the standalone mode for Wings, note that **renewal will try to bind port 80** which could fail if Nginx is running (for panel) or if firewall blocks it. In such cases, you might use the webroot or nginx plugin for the panel domain (which handles renewal without stopping ngin ([Creating SSL Certificates | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/tutorials/creating_ssl_certificates.html#:~:text=When%20you%20are%20using%20certbot%27s,opens%20new%20window))5】, and for the node domain, you might switch to DNS challenge for renewal or schedule a script to temporarily stop Wings during renewal. A simpler approach: use the Cloudflare DNS API with acme.sh for the node domain – this can auto-renew via DNS challenge without downti ([Creating SSL Certificates | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/tutorials/creating_ssl_certificates.html#:~:text=This%20is%20for%20advanced%20users%2C,Legacy))0】.

For our purposes, assuming both panel and node got certs via Certbot on their respective servers, the default systemd timers will renew them (usually runs twice a day to check). To be safe, you can add a cron entry. For example:
```bash
# crontab -e
0 2 * * * certbot renew --quiet --deploy-hook "systemctl restart nginx"
```
This attempts renewal daily at 2:00 AM and, if any cert was renewed, restarts Nginx to apply  ([Creating SSL Certificates | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/tutorials/creating_ssl_certificates.html#:~:text=You%27ll%20also%20probably%20want%20to,sudo)) ([Creating SSL Certificates | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/tutorials/creating_ssl_certificates.html#:~:text=0%2023%20,hook%20%22systemctl%20restart%20nginx))7】. You might also add a hook to restart Wings when its cert is renewed, since Wings may not pick up a changed cert file until resta ([Creating SSL Certificates | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/tutorials/creating_ssl_certificates.html#:~:text=systemctl%20start%20nginx)) ([Creating SSL Certificates | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/tutorials/creating_ssl_certificates.html#:~:text=You%20may%20also%20need%20to,automatically%20apply%20an%20updated%20certificate))4】. For instance:
```bash
0 3 * * * certbot renew --quiet --deploy-hook "systemctl restart wings"
``` 
(run at 3:00 AM, staggered from Nginx). Ensure the paths in renewal config for the node’s cert still work (if using standalone, renewal might fail if port 80 is in use – consider using `--renew-hook` to stop wings for a moment or use DNS challenge).

Keep an eye on your email for expiration warnings (Let’s Encrypt will email you if a cert is nearing expiration and hasn’t been renewed).

### Common SSL Issues and Solutions
Even with automation, you might hit a few snags:

- **Browser says “Not Secure” or Mixed Content:** This usually means some resources are being loaded via HTTP while the page is HTTPS. In Pterodactyl’s context, a known cause is not forcing redirect on the panel domain. If a user accesses `http://panel.example.com`, it might load some parts over http. We solved this by the Nginx 301 redirect. Another cause is if the **APP_URL** in the panel’s `.env` is still “http://”. Make sure it’s `https://panel.example.com`. Also, the file manager issue: if the daemon was on HTTP, the file list API would be http (blocked as mixed conten ([The list of files is not displayed with specific SSL settings · Issue #1403 · pterodactyl/panel · GitHub](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/issues/1403#:~:text=1,Image%3A%20image))8】. The fix is exactly what we did: secure the daemon. Parker, a Pterodactyl maintainer, notes that such an error likely means “panel is SSL and daemon is no ([The list of files is not displayed with specific SSL settings · Issue #1403 · pterodactyl/panel · GitHub](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/issues/1403#:~:text=parkervcp%20%20%20commented%20,67))9】. Ensuring both are on SSL (or both on http, but you want SSL in production) resolves it.
- **Daemon connection errors (red status):** If the panel can’t reach Wings, first test direct: from the panel server, try `curl https://node1.example.com:8080` and see if you get a response (it should say “Missing credentials” or similar JSON since you didn’t provide auth, but at least a TLS handshake). If it fails, check DNS resolution on panel server (`dig node1.example.com`) and ensure port 8080 is open. It could be firewall – e.g. if running on GCP/AWS, open the port in cloud firewall; if Ubuntu ufw, `ufw allow 8080`. Also verify Wings is running with `systemctl status wings`.
- **SSL handshake issues:** If you see errors about certificate verification in Wings or panel logs (or a browser error “certificate not valid”), ensure you used the correct domain. For example, if your node’s certificate is for node1.example.com and your panel is trying to contact it via some different hostname or IP, it will fail validation. Always use the exact domain on the cert. If needed, you can add additional `-d` to certbot for alternate names or use a wildcard cert for `*.example.com` (requires DNS challenge).
- **Cloudflare specific:** If using Cloudflare proxy for the panel and you set SSL mode to “Flexible”, Cloudflare will talk to your server over HTTP. This will cause Pterodactyl to think it’s http and can lead to redirects or mixed content. **Always use “Full (Strict)” SSL with Cloudflare** for Pterodactyl – meaning Cloudflare will connect to your server over HTTPS with a valid cert (the one we installed). Flexible is insecure (and not compatible with websocket traffic of the panel-daemon). Also, if cloud proxy is on, only Cloudflare’s IPs will hit your server – ensure you either disable any fail2ban or adjust real-ip settings to accept Cloudflare’s forwarded IP. Pterodactyl has a config for proxy as mentioned.
- **Renewal problems:** If `certbot renew` fails for the node because Nginx is running (panel’s Nginx might be using port 80), one workaround is to use the webroot plugin for the node as well by piggybacking on the panel’s Nginx. You could add a server block for node1.example.com in Nginx just for ACME challenge (serving a dummy site or the token). Or use the DNS challenge method via a script like `acme.sh` which the Pterodactyl docs recommend for advanced use ([Creating SSL Certificates | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/tutorials/creating_ssl_certificates.html#:~:text=For%20advanced%20users%2C%20we%20suggest,much%20more%20powerful%20than%20certbot))1】. The Pterodactyl docs even walk through using acme.sh with Cloudflare API for those who can’t open port  ([Creating SSL Certificates | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/tutorials/creating_ssl_certificates.html#:~:text=This%20is%20for%20advanced%20users%2C,Legacy))0】.

After everything, you should have: **HTTPS working on the panel** (green lock on `panel.example.com`) and **Wings operating with WSS** (no mixed content; panel shows node as connected). All web interface traffic and API calls are encrypted. This protects login credentials and session cookies, and is required for certain features like the file manager and console to work properly through the browser.

Lastly, whenever you add more nodes, repeat the domain + SSL steps for each (`node2.example.com`, etc.). Pterodactyl’s design expects each node to have a FQDN and proper SSL if the panel is S ([Installing Wings | Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#:~:text=WARNING))8】. By following the above guide, you’re aligning with widely used best practices: unique subdomains for panel and nod ([Pterodactyl Panel Installation Help : r/admincraft](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/zhmbvy/pterodactyl_panel_installation_help/#:~:text=Impossible))8】, A records pointing correctly, and Let’s Encrypt providing free security.
